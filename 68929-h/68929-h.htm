<p>In order that there may be no confusion, we desire to say that
the books listed above will be issued, during the respective
months, in New York City and vicinity. They may not reach
the readers, at a distance, promptly, on account of delays in

<p class="xxlargefont center">THE EAGLE SERIES</p>

<p class="center xlargefont">OF POPULAR FICTION</p>

<p class="center largefont">Principally Copyrights <span style="padding-left:1em">Elegant Colored Covers</span></p>

<p class="center xlargefont" style="word-spacing:0.5em">PRICE, TEN CENTS</p>

<p class="center smallfont">(Trade supplied exclusively by the American News Company and its branches.)</p>

<p>While the books in the New Eagle Series are undoubtedly
better value, being bigger books, the stories offered to the
public in this line must not be underestimated. There are
over four hundred copyrighted books by the famous authors,
which cannot be had in any other line. No other publisher
in the world has a line that contains so many different titles,
nor can any publisher ever hope to secure books that will
match those in the Eagle Series in quality.</p>

<p>This is the pioneer line of copyrighted ten cent novels,
and that it has struck popular fancy just right is proven by
the fact that for ten years it has been the first choice of
American readers. The only reason that we can afford to
give such excellent reading at ten cents per copy, is that
our unlimited capital and great organization enable us to
manufacture books more cheaply and to sell more of them
without expensive advertising, than any other publisher.</p>

<p class="center">ALL TITLES ALWAYS IN PRINT</p>

<p>NOTICE:—If these books are sent by mail, four cents must be
added to the price of each copy to cover postage.</p>

Only ten cents!</p>

<p>contains stories by Horatio Alger, Jr.,
Oliver Optic, G. A. Henty, Frank H.
Converse, James Otis and a hundred others
who are just as famous. Take our word
for it, a boy never bought better reading
matter or had a more generous list to select
from than what we are now offering

<div class="boxit2">
<p>¶ The days are past when it was unsafe for a
man to go alone beyond the Mississippi River,
but thousands of people like to read about the
old days in which the rattle of muskets and war
whoops of savages closely mingled.</p>

<p>¶ The Far West Library publishes stories of
the West as it was, and no one who likes vigorous
tales of the West can do better at any where
near the price, than these splendid stories.</p>

<p>¶ They were all written by a friend of Mr. Cody
who has had many narrow escapes in company
with the famous “Buffalo Bill” and who knows
that redoubtable warrior better than any other
living man.</p>

<p>¶ Bound in exceptionally attractive covers and
printed from good, clear, readable type.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the fact that the sales
of magazines have increased tremendously
during the past five or six years, the popularity
of a good paper-covered novel,
printed in attractive and convenient form,
remains undiminished.</p>

<p>There are thousands of readers who do
not care for magazines because the stories
in them, as a rule, are short and just about
the time they become interested in it, it
ends and they are obliged to readjust their
thoughts to a set of entirely different
characters.</p>

<p>The S. &amp; S. novel is long and complete
and enables the reader to spend many
hours of thorough enjoyment without doing
any mental gymnastics. Our paper-covered
books stand pre-eminent among
up-to-date fiction. Every day sees a new
copyrighted title added to the S. &amp; S.
lines, each one making them stronger,
better and more invincible.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">HATTIE’S LETTER.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Fancy a dingy old brick house on B—— street,
New York city—dusty outside and moldy in all its
ragged, papered walls inside—a dreary house with
small, poorly ventilated rooms—these rooms
wretchedly furnished, and I have made you at
home in “Miss Scrimp’s Boarding-House for ladies
only—no gentlemen boarded, lodged, or admitted.”</p>

<p>For this was the inscription on a faded tin sign
nailed over the front door.</p>

<p>And in this building existed—I will not say lived—most
of the time, between thirty and fifty working
girls, attracted there by the cheapness of board,
which enabled them to make ends meet on the
wretched wages due to “hard times,” or hard-hearted
employers, or perhaps to a medium between
the two.</p>

<p>Miss Scrimp, a maiden lady, who acknowledged
herself to be forty-five—one of the oldest boarders
said that had been her age for over ten years—only
charged four dollars a  week for boarders in her best,
lower rooms, and it ran as low as two dollars and a<span class="pagenum">[6]</span>
half in the upper story, and two attic chambers—for
this was a four-story house. She had but two
servants—one to cook, wash, and iron, the other a
pitiful, thin little creature, as errand girl, waitress,
maid of all work, and all work it was for her, from
early dawn till far into the night. She did all the
sweeping, set out the table, helped to wash and wipe
dishes, carried Miss Scrimp’s market-basket, went to
the grocery, cleaned and lighted lamps—indeed, did
almost everything that had to be done outside of the
kitchen, and bore the abuse of Biddy Lanigan, the
cook, and that of her mistress, like a little martyr,
as she in truth was.</p>

<p>Little Jess they called her—her full name was
Jessie Albemarle—was as good as she could be to
all around her, no matter how she was treated, but
there was one young girl in that house whom she
almost worshiped—first, because Hattie Butler was
very good to her; next, because Hattie was really
the most beautiful creature she had ever seen on
earth.</p>

<p>Though Hattie lodged in the very topmost room
of the house, when she came home weary from her
daily toil she would find her room swept as clean as
clean could be, fresh water in her pitcher, and often
a bouquet of flowers, picked up at market or elsewhere,
perfuming the little room. And she knew
Little Jess had done all this for the love there was
between them.</p>

<p>Hattie, I said before, was very beautiful. Just
seventeen, and entering on her eighteenth year, her
form was full of that slender grace so peculiar to
budding womanhood—just tall enough to pass the
medium, without being an approach to awkwardness.
Eyes of a jet, sparkling black, shaded by<span class="pagenum">[7]</span>
long, fringe-like lashes, features of the Grecian type,
complexion rich, but not too brown, the expressiveness
of her face a very marvel.</p>

<p>No one, to look at her white hands, her slim, tapering
fingers, her general appearance, even in her
plain dress, would have, at first glance, taken her
for a working girl, though she sewed folios in a
book-bindery down town for ten hours every day
sure, and often much longer when there was overwork
to do.</p>

<p>She was a quiet girl, making but few friends, and
no intimates, though when I write of her she had
been for nearly two years a boarder with Miss
Scrimp. The latter, for a wonder, liked her, though,
as a general thing, she seemed to hate pretty girls,
simply because they were pretty; while she had
most likely kept her state of single wretchedness
because she was more than plain—she was ugly.
She had a sharp, hook nose—a parrot-bill nose, if we
dare insult the bird by a comparison. She was cross-eyed,
and her eyes were small and greenish-gray
in hue. Her cheek bones were high, her chin long
and sharp. Her thin lips opened almost from ear to
ear, and in her dirty morning gown, slopping around,
her form looked like an old coffee-bag, half filled
with paper scraps, perambulating about over a pair
of old slippers—number sevens if an inch.</p>

<p>But Miss Scrimp really liked Hattie Butler, beautiful
as she was, and this was the reason:</p>

<p>At supper-time, before she ate a mouthful, every
Saturday night Hattie laid her board money, two
dollars and a half, down at the head of the table
where Miss Scrimp presided. It had been her habit
ever since she came; it was a good example to
others, though all did not follow it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[8]</span></p>

<p>Again, Hattie ate what was placed before her, and
never grumbled. She never found hairs in the rancid
butter; or, if she did, she kept it to herself. If
her bread was dry and hard she soaked it in her tea
or coffee, but did not turn her nose up as others did,
and threaten to go away if Miss Scrimp did not set
a better table.</p>

<p>And, best of all, Hattie was a light eater, as Miss
Scrimp often said, in hearing of her other boarders,
too sensible to hurt her complexion by using too
much greasy food.</p>

<p>Some of the homelier girls sometimes used the old
“gag,” if I may use a story term, and said “she lived
on love;” yet the dozen or more who worked in the
same bindery with her never saw her receive attentions
from any man—never saw any person approach
her in a lover-like way.</p>

<p>Her only fault to all who knew her was that there
was a mystery about her.</p>

<p>That she was a born lady, her manners, her quiet,
dignified way, her brief conversation, ever couched
in unexceptionable language, told plainly. But she
never told any one about herself. She never spoke
of parents or relatives—never alluded to past fortunes.
But Little Jess used to look in wonder at a
shelf of books in Hattie’s room. There were books
in French, German, and Spanish, and on Sundays,
when she sometimes stole up stairs to see her favorite
among all the boarders, she found her reading
these books. And she had a large portfolio of drawings,
and at times she added to them with a skillful
pencil.</p>

<p>One thing was certain. Hattie was very poor—she
had no income beyond that gained by her daily
labor. She washed her own clothes, and, by permission<span class="pagenum">[9]</span>
of Biddy Lanigan, ironed them on Saturday
evenings in the kitchen, for she had even a kind
word for Biddy, and kind words are almost as precious
as gold to the poor.</p>

<p>Hattie seldom was able to earn over four dollars a
week, as wages ran, and thus she had but little to
use for dress, though she was ever dressed with exceeding
taste, plain though her garments were.
These she cut and made, buying the patterns and
goods only.</p>

<p>When she had overwork she made more, and she
had been seen with a bank-book in her hand, so it
was evident she had saved something to help along
with should sickness overtake her.</p>

<p>She had been two years and one week boarding at
Miss Scrimp’s, when one Thursday the postman, or
mail-carrier, rather, delivered a letter at the door directed
to her.</p>

<p>Hattie was down at the bindery then, and Jessie
Albemarle, answering the bell, got the letter. She
would have kept it till Hattie came, but her mistress
demanded to see it, and took charge of it.</p>

<p>Little Jess had seen that it was a large letter,
postmarked from somewhere in California, and that
it had a singular seal in wax on the back. The impression
represented two hearts pierced with an arrow.</p>

<p>The address was only the name, street, number,
and city.</p>

<p>Miss Scrimp looked at it very closely. Had there
been no seal, only gum as a closing medium, it is
possible her examination might have been closer.</p>

<p>Biddy Lanigan, once when she quarreled with her
mistress and employer, boldly twitted her with having<span class="pagenum">[10]</span>
“stamed” letters over her “tay-kettle” and then
opened them.</p>

<p>“This is a man’s handwrite!” muttered Miss
Scrimp. “I don’t like my boarders having men to
write to ’em. But this one is away off in Californy—like
as not, rich as all creation. I wish I knew
who he is and what he wants. I’ll hand her the letter
afore all the boarders at supper to-night, and if
she opens it, I’ll watch her face, and maybe I can
guess from that what’s up. She’ll never tell no other
way. She has just the closest little mouth I ever did
see. But come to think, she mightn’t open it at the
table. She wouldn’t be apt to, for all the girls
would be curious to know if it was a love-letter, and
plague her, maybe. And she is too good a girl to be
plagued. I’ll keep it till after she has had supper
and gone to her room, and then I’ll go up, friendly-like
and take a chair—if there’s two in her room,
which I’m not sure of—hand her the letter, and wait
till she opens it. And I’ll ask her if her brother in
Californy is well—make as if some one had told me
she had a brother there.”</p>

<p>This plan, talked over to herself, satisfied Miss
Scrimp, and she put the letter in one of her capacious
pockets, there to remain till evening.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">MISS SCRIMP’S DISAPPOINTMENT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The cracked bell, which had done service all those
long years in the establishment of Miss Scrimp, had
rung its discordant call for supper. The hour was
late, for many of her boarders worked till dark, and
had some distance to walk to reach home, and the
dining-room was dimly lighted by two hanging
lamps, one over each end of the table. They served,
however, to show the scattered array of thin sliced
bread, still thinner slices of cold meat, and the small
plates of very pale butter laid along at distant intervals.
Also to show dimly a few rosy faces, but
many worn and pale ones—almost all having, like
Cassius, “a lean and hungry look.”</p>

<p>The rosy faces were new-comers, who had left
good country homes to learn sad lessons in city life.</p>

<p>Little Jessie was hurrying to and fro, carrying
the cups of hot beverage, which her mistress called
tea, to the boarders, and answering the impatient
cries of those not yet served as fast as she could.</p>

<p>Biddy Lanigan, who stood almost six feet high,
was fleshy to boot, and had a face almost as red as
the coals she worked over, stood with her arms
akimbo at the door, which opened into the kitchen,
ready for a bitter answer should any fault-finder’s
voice reach her ear, and also prepared to refill the
tea-urn with hot water when it ran low, on the principle
that a second cup of tea should never be as
strong as the first.</p>

<p>There was a murmur of many voices at first, but<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>
the clatter of knives and forks, and cups and saucers
soon drowned all this, and until the dishes were
literally emptied, little other noise could be heard.</p>

<p>Long before the rest were done sweet Hattie Butler
had finished her single slice of bread and butter,
one cracker and a cup of tea, and gone to her room.
Grim and silent, yet keenly overlooking the appetite
of each boarder, sat Miss Scrimp, until all were
through, and had gone to their rooms, or into the
old dingy room, slanderously called a parlor, to chat
awhile before retiring.</p>

<p>Then Biddy Lanigan came in with two extra cups
of strong tea, one for the mistress, the other for herself—a
plate of baked potatoes and a couple of nice
chops.</p>

<p>Poor Jessie Albemarle had her supper to make
from the little—the very little the hungry boarders
had left.</p>

<p>Miss Scrimp was not long at the table. She was
burning with curiosity about the letter in her pocket,
and so she took a small lamp in her hand and
threaded her way up the steep, narrow, uncarpeted
stairs to the attic where our heroine lodged.</p>

<p>Knocking at the door, it was opened by Hattie
quickly, who, with her wealth of jet-black hair,
glossy as silk, all let down over her shoulders,
looked, if possible, tenfold more beautiful than she
had below, with her hair neatly bound up so as not
to be in the way when she was at her work.</p>

<p>Hattie had been reading, for on her little stand,
near the bed, was a lamp and an open book.</p>

<p>There were not two chairs in the room, but Hattie
proffered her only one to Miss Scrimp, and waited to
learn the cause of this unexpected visit, for Miss
Scrimp never called on a boarder without she was<span class="pagenum">[13]</span>
behindhand in her board, and then her calls were
not visits of compliment or pleasure either.</p>

<p>“I do declare—only one chair here, Miss Hattie?
It’s a shame—I’ll rate Jess soundly for her neglect!”
said Miss Scrimp, looking around as if she
did not know how poorly the room was furnished.</p>

<p>“Do not scold her, Miss Scrimp. I do not need but
one chair—I never have any company to occupy
another. Sit down—I will sit on my bed as I often
do.”</p>

<p>“Well—thankee, I will sit down, for it is tiresome
coming up those long stairs. I came up to tell you
I had a letter for you the letter-carrier left to-day. I
didn’t want to give it to you down at table, for them
giddy girls are always noticing everything, and they
might have thought it was a love-letter, and tried to
tease you. Here it is.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Miss Scrimp, you were very considerate,”
said Hattie, gently, as she received the letter,
looked calmly at the superscription, and then opened
it at the end of the envelope with a dainty little
pearl-handled knife.</p>

<p>Miss Scrimp watched every shade on Hattie’s face
as the girl read the letter. There was an eager look
in her eyes as they scanned the first few lines, then
a sudden pallor, and it was followed by a tremulous
flush that suffused brow, cheeks, and even her
neck.</p>

<p>In spite of an apparent endeavor to keep calm,
Hattie was to some extent agitated. She knew that
those cross-eyes were fixed upon her, and she did
not intend, if she had a secret, to share it with the
owner of them.</p>

<p>In a very short time the letter was read and restored
to its envelope, and now Miss Scrimp thought<span class="pagenum">[14]</span>
it time to try the plan she had formed for finding
out who had written to her favorite boarder.</p>

<p>“Hope you’ve good news from your brother, Miss
Hattie,” she said. “I heard some one say you had
a brother in Californy. Hope he is doin’ well. It’s
an awful country for gettin’ rich in, I’ve heard say.”</p>

<p>“My letter brings me very pleasant news, Miss
Scrimp. I thank you again for the trouble you took
to bring it up to me. You are always kind to me.”</p>

<p>“I ought to be, dear. I haven’t another boarder
in this house, out of forty-three all told now, who is
as punctual and so little trouble as you. And you
can tell your brother so when you write to him.”</p>

<p>“When I do write to my brother I will surely
mention you, Miss Scrimp,” said Hattie, with an
amused smile.</p>

<p>For, with quick intuition, she saw the aim of the
curious woman.</p>

<p>“You didn’t say if he was doing well?” continued
Miss Scrimp, determined to get some information.</p>

<p>“The letter only refers to business of mine—not to
that of any one else,” said Hattie, gently but firmly.</p>

<p>“You’ll not answer it now, will you? I might mail
it early, you know, when I go out for milk, for I’m
first up in the house.”</p>

<p>“I shall not answer it to-night, Miss Scrimp. I am
very tired, and am going right to bed. I thank you
for your kind offer as much as if I accepted it.”</p>

<p>Beaten at every point, and so gently and graciously
that she could not take offense, Miss Scrimp
took up her lamp with a sigh, and said:</p>

<p>“Poor, dear thing, I know you must be tired. If
your brother is getting rich, as he must be, there in
that land of silver and gold, I should think he’d
send for you to go to him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[15]</span></p>

<p>“Good-night, kind Miss Scrimp—good-night,” was
all that Hattie answered, as she made a motion
toward preparing for bed.</p>

<p>“Good-night, dear—good-night,” said Miss Scrimp,
a little snappishly, for she had made that long, upstair
journey for nothing.</p>

<p>The door closed, and poor Hattie was alone.</p>

<p>And tears came into her eyes now, and she knelt
down and prayed.</p>

<p>“Heavenly Father, aid me and tell me what to
do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[16]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE FOREMAN’S DISCOVERY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The bindery in which Hattie Butler, with over
one hundred other persons, male and female,
worked, was famous for doing very fine private
work, outside of that done for many publishers who
had their work contracted for there. Gentlemen of
wealth and taste, who had rare old works in worn-out
covers, and wished them preserved in more
stately dress, frequently brought them there for the
purpose of outer renovation.</p>

<p>So it happened that on the very morning which
succeeded the night when Hattie received the California
letter, a fine equipage, from far up town,
stopped in the narrow street which fronted the
bindery, and an elderly, old-fashioned gentleman
got out and toiled up the stairs to the bindery floor
with a bundle of some size under one arm.</p>

<p>He was met, quite obsequiously, by Mr. W——,
one of the proprietors, who knew, by past experience,
that some nice, well-paying work was in
view, and asked into the office.</p>

<p>“No, no, I am in a hurry,” said the old gentleman.
“I want to see your foreman—I have some
French and German reviews here—old and rare—which
are all to pieces and somewhat mixed up. I
bought them at an auction—a regular old bookworm
once owned them, but he died, and his graceless
heirs sold off the collection of years for a mere
song, compared to their real value. I wish these
properly collated, and bound nicely for my library.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[17]</span></p>

<p>“The foreman will wait upon you, Mr. Legare, in
a few moments,” said the proprietor. “Take a seat
by this table.”</p>

<p>The man of wealth sat down, and Mr. W—— sent
a boy after the foreman.</p>

<p>The latter came and looked over the mixed up
and scattered pages with a perplexed look.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you can do nothing with them,” said
Mr. Legare, noticing the expression in the foreman’s
face. “I am sorry, for I doubt if a second copy of
either work can be found in this city, or indeed in
America.”</p>

<p>“Try, Mr. Jones—try your very best,” said Mr.
W——, anxiously.</p>

<p>“I think we can do it, sir,” said the foreman,
brightening up. “I accidentally discovered that one
of our girls, Hattie Butler, is a good linguist—reads
German and French as well as she does English—one
of our best and most quiet girls, too.”</p>

<p>“Send for her, please,” said Mr. Legare. “I do so
want to preserve these works in good shape.”</p>

<p>And presently Hattie Butler stood before the trio—one
of her employers, Mr. Legare, and the foreman—calm
and lady-like, neat in her white apron
and brown calico dress, her black hair wound in a
queenly crown about her shapely head.</p>

<p>“Hattie, see what can be done with these old reviews,”
said the foreman, with the familiar, bossy
style peculiar to too many of his class.</p>

<p>The young girl took up the French work, and instantly
said:</p>

<p>“This is very old. A French review of Dante’s
‘Inferno.’ Some pages, I see, are misplaced; but if
all are here, sir, I can soon arrange them.”</p>

<p>Mr. W—— looked at Mr. Legare triumphantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[18]</span></p>

<p>“The German work—can you arrange that also,
young lady?” asked Mr. Legare, looking in wonder
at this beautiful girl, so young, working here, yet
evidently a scholar.</p>

<p>Hattie took up the other review, glanced over the
pages, and replied:</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I see that this is a bitter attack on
Martin Luther, and must date with the first ages of
the Protestant Reformation.”</p>

<p>“Great Heaven! why, young lady, what are you
doing here with such an education?”</p>

<p>“Working, sir, as thousands do in this great city
and elsewhere, for my daily bread.”</p>

<p>“Sewing folios at the bench, and we have no better
in the shop,” added the foreman.</p>

<p>“Do you understand any other languages?” asked
the wondering man of wealth.</p>

<p>“Italian and Spanish, sir. I was taught by my
mother, who was not only a fine linguist, but had
traveled a great deal in the countries where these
various languages are spoken. I was born in
Italy.”</p>

<p>“Yet of American parentage?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“This is no place for you, young lady. Your education
should place you in a far higher sphere.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, sir. Shall I at once go to work to arrange
these pages? I will sew them myself when I
have them all right, so there will be no mistake.”</p>

<p>“Yes—yes—thank you. I will reward you well,”
said Mr. Legare, with unusual warmth, for he was a
very steady, precise old gentleman, generally, in all
things.</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir; all pay and emoluments must go
to my employers. I receive my wages—no more.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[19]</span></p>

<p>And Hattie, with a graceful bow, took up the scattered
pages, and went to her work-bench.</p>

<p>“W——, who on earth is this prodigy? The mistress
of five languages—for she speaks English perfectly,
and as pretty and lady-like as any woman
that I ever met.”</p>

<p>The proprietor almost blushed when he said:</p>

<p>“My dear Mr. Legare, she has worked here, I believe,
for nearly two years, at the same bench, and
until to-day I never knew her acquirements. I have
often noticed her beauty and extreme modesty, for
she has avoided all intimacies in the shop, but nothing
beyond this has attracted my notice. I never
make myself familiar with my hands—seldom speak
to them, except through the foreman. I am as much
surprised as you at this discovery, and shall promote
the girl at once, and increase her wages. Our
work has increased so much—private work, like
yours, that as a collator, translator, and arranger,
she will have enough to do nearly all the time. Mr.
Jones, you can so inform her, and prepare a table in
some quiet part of the shop, where there is little
noise, and she will not be disturbed.”</p>

<p>The foreman turned away with a bow of acquiescence,
but was recalled to receive directions as to
the style of binding required by Mr. Legare for the
new works.</p>

<p>“This young lady—Miss Butler, I believe, is her
name—will tell you what titles to put on the backs,
and be sure to have the original dates of the issue of
works there also. I am very particular about that.”</p>

<p>“I know it, sir, and we will be very careful,” said
the foreman.</p>

<p>And when the man of wealth and influence turned
to leave, Mr. W—— went down the stairs with him,<span class="pagenum">[20]</span>
and saw him into his carriage, and stood bare-headed
on the sidewalk until he had driven away.</p>

<p>And this is Republican, Democratic America!</p>

<p>No kings, nor dukes, nor lords here—but to the
sovereignty of wealth the reddest or blackest republican,
or the noisiest democrat, bends his servile
knee and cowering head more abjectly than any
serf in Russia bows before the imperial form.</p>

<p>Independence! Bah! ’Tis but a name!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">TEA-TABLE TALK.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>There was a regular flutter in the boarding-house
of Miss Scrimp when the bindery girls got in that
Friday evening; for they brought the news that
Hattie Butler had been promoted in the bindery, a
new position given her, and her wages raised to ten
dollars a week. Some of the girls were really glad,
for Hattie had ever been so gentle, so quiet, so kind
when any of them were sick, that she had few enemies.
But others were envious of her good fortune,
as they ever had been of her beauty, so there were
a few to sneer and hint that Mr. Jones, the foreman,
or Mr. W——, one of the proprietors, had only promoted
her because she was handsome, and they
wanted her off by herself where they could talk to
her and say things the other girls couldn’t hear.</p>

<p>The object of the flutter, the laudation, and the
envy, seemed all this time to care the least for her
promotion of any that knew it. She did not speak
of it, even to Miss Scrimp, at whose right hand her
chair at table was always placed; but the latter had
heard of it before Hattie got home, and was ready
with her congratulations the instant Hattie sat
down.</p>

<p>“I’m awful glad to hear you’ve been set up in the
bindery, and get so much better wages, dear,” she
said.</p>

<p>And she screwed her sallow cheeks and thin lips
into a picture of a smile which Nast would glory to
copy, if he could only have seen it.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Miss Scrimp; but I do not know as it<span class="pagenum">[22]</span>
will be much better for me. My former work was
very easy. It only exercised my fingers. This will
tax both fingers and brain. My head aches over it
already.”</p>

<p>“Dear, dear! Well, I’ll have Biddy Lanigan make
you a real strong cup of tea and some toast.”</p>

<p>“No, thank you, Miss Scrimp, I do not wish it. The
food which is good enough for the rest always satisfies
me.”</p>

<p>“I know it, dear. You never find fault, and that
makes me so much the more ready to better your
fare when I can. And that reminds me—Miss Dolhear
has got sick and gone home to the country; she
that came here, poor thing, to learn dress-making;
and her room, on the second floor, front, is empty
now, and you shall have it for only one dollar more
than you pay now, though I charged her two. Her
folks were well off: they used to write and send her
money, and I guess she got sick a-eatin’ too much
cake and candy. Her room is all stuck up with it.
But I’ll have Little Jess clean it out for you, if you’ll
take it.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Miss Scrimp, I do not wish to change.
I feel very much at home in my little chamber, and
the higher one gets in the city the purer is the air
they breathe.”</p>

<p>“Dear, dear! I thought you’d like to change. But
you know what you like best. Do let me call Biddy
and have some toast made for you.”</p>

<p>“No, thank you, Miss Scrimp. There is plenty before
me, I am sure.”</p>

<p>“Dear! dear! That’s just your own nice way always.
I never heard a complaint from your lips,
and there’s some that are never satisfied.”</p>

<p>And here Miss Scrimp sent a scornful, cross eyed<span class="pagenum">[23]</span>
glance down the table. But no one could tell exactly
at whom she was looking, so the look didn’t
hurt anybody.</p>

<p>As Hattie made no further remark, the usual clatter
of knives and forks on slenderly-filled plates was
alone heard for a time.</p>

<p>But when Hattie, as usual, arose earliest of all, and
went to her room, quite an unusual rush of conversation,
and all about her, commenced.</p>

<p>“Such luck! From four dollars a week to ten, and
all because she can talk Dutch!” said one—a very
plain and a very ignorant girl.</p>

<p>“Ten dollars? How she’ll shine out in silk on Sundays,
I’ll bet, and look for a beau as fast as the best
of us,” said another. “She couldn’t do it in ten-cent
calico. Oh, no, the proud thing!”</p>

<p>“She is not a girl of that kind,” cried another,
warmly. “She is the prettiest girl in this house to-night,
and you all know it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, stick up for her, Sally Perkins. We know
why. When you had the measles so bad she lost
three days work sitting up with you and waiting on
you.”</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven she did,” cried Sally, earnestly.
“I might have died before one of you would have
done as much for me. She is a living angel if ever
there was one. So there now. I’ll never speak to a
girl that breathes a word against her so long as I
live.”</p>

<p>“Good for Sally Perkins,” cried a dozen in a
breath, for more than one in that crowd of girls had
received kindness from Hattie Butler when kindness
was so much needed.</p>

<p>And the battle of tongues grew less and less, and
soon tea was over, and the girls scattered as usual.<span class="pagenum">[24]</span>
Some to their rooms, weary enough to go right to
rest—others to linger a little while in the old parlor
and get others to fix up their scanty wardrobe so as
to be ready for their only day of rest or pleasure—the
blessed Sunday so near at hand—but one day of
toil to intervene.</p>

<p>Our heroine—where was she? In her little chamber
thanking her Heavenly Father that at last the
stern strife for daily bread was made easier to her,
and that a glimmer of light could be seen through
the dark clouds of poverty.</p>

<p>Pure-hearted and innocent, she did not dream that
any one could so envy her good fortune as to hate
her for it. If she had she would have prayed God to
forgive them.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">DOES HE LOVE HER?</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Mr. W——, one of the proprietors of the bindery
where our heroine worked—a junior partner, but the
chief manager of the concern, was a single man, not
yet forty, in the very prime of life. He was, as a
man, not as a fop, very good-looking. His stalwart
frame, well-developed, showed his American birth;
but his full, round, rosy face spoke also of his English
paternity. He had thus far in life been too busy
to think of matrimony, and, living with his parents,
who were in easy circumstances, he had never
known the want of a home, or the need of a wife to
make home bright. His sisters, of whom he had
two, considerably younger than himself, had ever
seen to his linen—his tailor looked to his wardrobe—he
had little to trouble himself about. He belonged
to a coterie or club of bachelors, and was
never at a loss about a place to spend his evenings
in.</p>

<p>But that day, when the wealthy and influential
Mr. Legare had told Hattie Butler that she deserved
to be in a higher sphere, had opened Mr. W——’s
eyes—opened them to the wonderful beauty as well
as the surprising talent of the girl who had worked
at low wages without a murmur for over two years
in his shop.</p>

<p>He had noticed her quiet modesty in contrast with
the boldness of other girls often before, but that
very shrinking modesty had also kept her beauty in
the background.</p>

<p>And that very afternoon he had taken occasion in<span class="pagenum">[26]</span>
person to look at her work, as her slim, tapering
fingers gathered up missing pages and placed them
where they belonged; and he asked her many questions,
in a kinder tone than he was accustomed to
use to his employees; for there was to him a very
sweet music in the voice that answered his queries.</p>

<p>And when he went home that evening he was
strangely absent-minded. When his Sister Flotie
asked him if he would not get opera tickets and
take her and Anna to hear “Lucia” on the Monday
night following, he said:</p>

<p>“Yes, Miss Hattie—yes; with pleasure.”</p>

<p>“Hattie? Who is Hattie, brother, that you should
use that name instead of Flotie, when you answer
me?”</p>

<p>“Did I? I didn’t mean to; but I am full of Hattie
some way. I went to write a letter to our paper
manufacturer, and had got a dozen lines written,
when I saw I had headed it, ‘Dear Hattie.’ There is
a girl in the bindery of that name—a most remarkable
girl. I will tell you all I know about her. She
looks and acts like a princess in disguise.”</p>

<p>And then Mr. W—— gave a very highly colored
description of our heroine and her acquirements.</p>

<p>“And you have let this prodigy of beauty and
learning, of modesty and goodness, work for you for
two years at little better than starvation wages?
Coward! I’m ashamed of you, if you are my
brother,” cried Flotie, warmly.</p>

<p>“Sis, don’t break out that way. We pay the usual
rates. Were we to pay higher, we could not compete
with other binderies and keep up.”</p>

<p>“But four dollars a week to pay board and washing,
and dress with! Why, it wouldn’t keep me in
gloves.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[27]</span></p>

<p>“Yet thousands of poor girls work for and live on
less, my peerless sister. You, who know no want
that is not supplied almost as soon as expressed,
know little how poor girls and women have to struggle
to keep their heads above the tide. But my
heroine is better off now. I have given her other
work, and raised her salary to ten dollars a week.”</p>

<p>“Good! good! You have some heart after all,
Ned.”</p>

<p>“I begin to think I have,” said Mr. W——, with a
sigh.</p>

<p>“Here! here! No nonsense, brother mine. Don’t
make a fool of yourself by falling in love with your
pretty employee. She may be very pretty, very
modest, and good, but I don’t want a bindery girl
for a sister-in-law. Remember that.”</p>

<p>Mr. W——’s answer was another sigh. He seemed
lost in thought, and, as he had promised the opera
tickets, Flotie left him to his thoughts, and went to
tell Anna about her brother’s new discovery, as well
as to announce that they were to hear “Lucia” on
the coming Monday night.</p>

<p>“Do you think Brother Edward is really in love
with this shop-girl?” asked Anna, in a serious tone,
when Flotie had told her story.</p>

<p>“I think he is a little smitten, but seriously in love—no.
Not a bit of it. Edward is too much engrossed
in business to fall in love in good earnest. He
hasn’t leisure for that. Besides, he has too much
sense to ever think of marrying for beauty, and out
of his own sphere, too. There are rich girls who
would snap at him for the asking.”</p>

<p>“Flotie, love—real love—laughs at riches.”</p>

<p>“May be so, Anna; but love—real love, as you
call it—never—scorns a diamond engagement-ring,<span class="pagenum">[28]</span>
nor refuses to wear satin and Valenciennes lace for
a wedding suit. Where would the bindery girl on
four, or even ten dollars a week, find them?”</p>

<p>“Ned would find them for her fast enough, if he
loved her. But say, Flotie, what will we wear on
Monday night? That is the question for the hour.
You know the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">creme de la creme</i> of society will be
there, and we must uphold the family credit.”</p>

<p>“Yes, even if papa heaves a heavy sigh over our
demands. Let me think. We’ll go up stairs and
look over our wardrobe, see what we have, and then
we’ll know what we must have. Come, pet.”</p>

<p>And away went the two loving sisters—girls yet,
though both were past their teens.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">JOY TO TOIL-WORN HEARTS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Mr. Legare, after leaving the bindery, drove, or
was taken in his carriage, to a prominent bank, in
which he was heavily interested, both as a stockholder
and depositor, transacted some business there,
then took a turn down Wall street to look into some
stocks there, and returned home just in time for
lunch.</p>

<p>He was met at the table by his two children—Frank,
a son of five-and-twenty years, and Lizzie, a
daughter just five years younger. His wife, their
mother, had passed away two years before, leaving
sweet memories only to cheer their saddened hearts,
for as wife and mother she had been a treasure on
earth.</p>

<p>“Well, children, how have you spent your morning?”
asked the fond and ever indulgent father.</p>

<p>“I have been over in Forty-Fifth street, father,
calling on your old friend, Mr. ——,” said Frank.
“I love to visit the dear old fellow, and to hear him
talk of his travels in Europe. He is droll, yet there
is a vein of true philosophy in all he says. And his
sketches of scenes he visited are so full of life and
interest. An invalid, yet so cheerful—it would cure
a misanthrope to visit him once in a while.”</p>

<p>“He is a good man, Frank, and I am glad you like
to visit him. He has seen much of the world, and
you can learn a great deal in conversing with him.
And now, daughter, dear, how have you spent your
afternoon?”</p>

<p>“I started out to go a-shopping, papa. You know<span class="pagenum">[30]</span>
you handed me a roll of money last night for that
purpose. I went on foot, for I like exercise on a
sunny morning like this. Only a little way from
here, in front of the drug store on the next avenue, I
saw a young girl, a mere child of ten or eleven years,
crying bitterly. I asked her what was the matter,
and learned, through her many sobs, that she had
come with only seven cents, the last money she or
her mother had in the world, to get medicine for
that mother, who was sick. The medicine named
in the prescription cost twenty cents, and the druggist
would not let her have it without the money. I
took the poor thing by the hand and went in and
got the medicine for her, and in the meantime found
out where she lived, in an alley only four blocks,
dear father, from this rich home, in the basement
of one of the old tumble-down houses, which are a
disgrace to the city. I don’t know but I did wrong,
papa, but I couldn’t help it. I went home with that
little girl and saw her poor mother, sick, with four
children, actually starving, in an unfurnished cellar—no
food, no fire—nothing but want and
wretchedness to meet my view. Father, there is a
fire there now, and plenty to eat. The sick woman
is on a good bed, our doctor has taken her case in
hand, and the children, in decent clothes, will go to
school next week. But I have not been shopping.
I found better use for my money.”</p>

<p>“God bless my girl—my noble girl,” said Mr. Legare,
and tears came in his eyes as he spoke.
“Frank, my boy, Lizzie has outstripped us both in
good works, though we both may have done some
good; you in visiting and cheering up my invalid
friend, and I—well, I, too, have had an adventure,
and perhaps have been the indirect cause of bettering<span class="pagenum">[31]</span>
the condition of a poor, hard-working girl—the
loveliest creature, by the way, that I ever saw, at
home or abroad. And talented, too, the mistress of
five languages; and, Lizzie, not so old, I should
judge, as you, by a year or two.”</p>

<p>“Where did you meet this prodigy of beauty and
learning, father?” asked the son.</p>

<p>“At W——’s book-bindery, where I took some
valuable old reviews for binding. She has worked
there over two years, earning and supporting herself
on four dollars a week. And until some one was
needed to collate and arrange my old German and
French reviews, her knowledge of languages had remained
undiscovered. She bears an excellent character—is
modest, pure, and unassuming. I was glad
to hear Mr. W—— order his foreman to assign her
to new and more pleasant duties, at ten dollars a
week.”</p>

<p>“So, dear papa, you, too, brought joy to a toil-worn
heart.”</p>

<p>“I hope so, child, I hope so. She told me she
owed her education to a gifted mother. I saw her
lips tremble and her eyes moisten when she spoke,
and, thinking of our own loss, my children, I forbore
to question her then. But I shall, by and by, for
I feel strangely interested in her. So very, very
beautiful; so talented, and yet in such humble circumstances.
In looks, in manners, in conversation
a lady who would grace any society, yet, after all,
only a poor book-bindery girl.”</p>

<p>Lunch, which had been going on all this time,
was over, and Mr. Legare, mentioning that he had
some letters to write, went to his library, while the
brother and sister went off, arm in arm, to a favorite
alcove in the adjoining drawing-room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[32]</span></p>

<p>“Frank, what do you think of this new discovery
which our dear father has been telling us of? I
never knew him to speak with such enthusiastic admiration
of any one before.”</p>

<p>“Neither did I, Lizzie,” said Frank, gravely.
“Seriously, sister, I must go and see this peerless
girl—see her, too, before father goes there again, if
I can. I do not want a step-mother younger than
you are, dear.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Frank! Papa would never think of that!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Lizzie. He is young for his years.
He has led a careful, temperate life, and is not beyond
his prime either mentally or physically.
Stranger things have happened. I repeat, I must go
and see this girl for myself. W—— is a warm
friend of mine, and will help me if there’s any
danger.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know but you are right, Frank. Go, if
you think best.”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum">[33]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">WHO CAN SHE BE?</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Mr. W—— was rather surprised to receive quite
an early call at his bindery from the son of his
wealthy patron—the younger Legare. He had met
Frank at his club, and on “the road,” for both drove
fast horses; but the young man had never before
visited the bindery, though his father often did.</p>

<p>Mr. W——, however, received his visitor with
great cordiality, and asked what he could do for him.</p>

<p>“I would like to see you in your private office
a moment,” said young Legare, who had, when he
entered the large room, cast a keen and searching
glance at all the hands—men, boys, and girls—whom
his eye could reach.</p>

<p>“Certainly. Step this way,” said Mr. W——,
leading the way to a room partitioned off at the
upper end of the main bindery. “Take a seat, Mr.
Legare,” he said, pointing to a luxurious arm-chair,
cushioned and backed with morocco.</p>

<p>“Thank you. I will detain you but a moment,”
said Frank. “My father was here yesterday?”</p>

<p>“Yes; he left some work, which will be finished
by to-morrow. He is one of my best patrons,” replied
W——.</p>

<p>“He discovered a prodigy here yesterday,” said
young Legare.</p>

<p>“A prodigy?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; at least he seems to think so, for he
talked like a crazy man about her—a girl beautiful
as a houri, and as learned as she is beautiful, the
mistress, he said, of no less than five languages.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[34]</span></p>

<p>“Ah, yes! You allude to Hattie Butler. She is
rather pretty, and certainly quite gifted as a linguist.”</p>

<p>“What will you take to send her away where he
will never see her again?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Legare! I hardly understand you.”</p>

<p>“I think I spoke quite plainly. I asked you what
you would take to send her away where he would
never see her again. Do you understand that?”</p>

<p>“I think I do,” said Mr. W——, flushing up. “But
you must understand I never discharge a good and
willing hand without a fault, when there is work to
do for that hand. This young woman has worked
for us over two years without committing an error.”</p>

<p>“Is it no error to snare an old man like my father,
because he happens to be rich, with a display of her
beauty and learning?”</p>

<p>“Snare! Mr. Legare, have you been drinking, or
what is the matter with you?”</p>

<p>“I have not been drinking, Mr. W——, and I am
in very sober earnest in what I say. My father,
though old, is very impressible, and perhaps you
know it. He came home to lunch yesterday, and
could talk of nothing but the beauty and talent of
this girl.”</p>

<p>“Why, he was not in here over ten or fifteen minutes
altogether, and his conversation with her may
have occupied three or four minutes of that time.”</p>

<p>“Well, it was long enough to do us—my sister and
myself—perhaps an irreparable injury. In short,
from the old gentleman’s enthusiasm, we feared he
would court and marry this girl before we could
take a step to prevent it, and we made up our minds
to prevent such a folly if we could.”</p>

<p>“I doubt very much, Mr. Legare, whether such a<span class="pagenum">[35]</span>
folly, as you rightly term it, has originated in any
brain but your own. I was present at the only interview
your father has ever had with this young
woman, and only the books, and how to bind them,
was the subject of conversation. It was brief and
business-like, nothing more.”</p>

<p>“Can I see the young woman?”</p>

<p>“We are not in the habit of exhibiting our employees,
Mr. Legare,” said W——, with considerable
hauteur. “But if you choose to walk about the bindery
with me, you can see every person in it, while
examining my work, machinery, and so forth; but
I will not permit any remarks made that can hurt
the feelings of an employee.”</p>

<p>“I would be the last to do it, sir; and you need
not point out this prodigy—if she is so very beautiful,
and so superior in her grace and manners, I am
sure I shall be able to discover her without aid.”</p>

<p>“Very well, Mr. Legare. We will pass through the
various departments, as visitors frequently do.”</p>

<p>The young man assented, and with Mr. W——
moved through the large hall, looking at folders,
sewers, gilders, and pasters, all busy at their various
tasks, and examined with rather a careless eye all
the newly-patented machinery for cutting and pressing,
though Mr. W—— strove to point out the great
improvements of the age as well as he could.</p>

<p>They had passed through a greater part of the
bindery, and young Legare had looked with a surprised
eye on many a pretty form and interesting
face, for he, like too many of the upper or non-laboring
class, had imbued the idea that beauty and
labor, grace and toil, intellect and worth, could not
go hand in hand, or indeed have any connection.</p>

<p>They now came to where a young girl, with her<span class="pagenum">[36]</span>
braided hair, dark as night, wound around a finely
poised head, sat with her face toward a window—a
screen on either side partially shutting her in from
general observation. She was bent over some scattered
pages, evidently arranging them, and young
Legare, glancing at the pages, saw that they were
old, in a foreign language, and had belonged to a
pile of torn and faded magazines that lay on the
table to her left.</p>

<p>One glance at that form, at the shapely head, and
graceful neck and shoulders, and a start of surprise,
a flush in his face, told that Legare had found the
wonderful girl of whom his father had spoken.</p>

<p>Hearing steps close to her table, the beautiful girl
turned to see who was there, and, seeing Mr. W——
with a stranger by his side, turned again to her
work. But that one glance revealed to young Legare
such a face as he had never seen before—a face
wonderfully beautiful and full of expression.</p>

<p>The two passed on until beyond her hearing, and
Legare said, in a low tone:</p>

<p>“I thank you, Mr. W——, and need look no farther.
I do not wonder that such beauty, combined
with education and talent, struck my father with
surprise. Who can she be? She was not born to
labor; her hands are small, her fingers tapering and
delicate—every feature that of a lady. I had but a
single glance, but if I was only an artist I could
paint her portrait from memory.”</p>

<p>Mr. W—— smiled.</p>

<p>“You also are enthusiastic as well as your father.
But I assure you that neither you nor he need feel
any fear, or dream of any snares being laid for
either of you. It is true, the young girl is beautiful—but
she is poor, and dependent on the labor of her<span class="pagenum">[37]</span>
hands for her living. She has evidently no ambitions
beyond it, for here at her bench for over two
years she has been a silent, quiet, unobtrusive
worker, making no complaints, asking no favors,
shunning all acquaintances—noted only for her
modesty and retiring, quiet way.”</p>

<p>“She is a wonder,” said Mr. Legare, with a sigh.
“I thank you for your kindness, Mr. W——.”</p>

<p>Then he left the bindery without another word.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum">[38]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">WHAT CAN THIS MEAN?</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Mr. W—— echoed the sigh which left his visitor’s
lips when the latter departed. And the wealthy
binder looked toward the screens which hid fair
Hattie Butler from general view—looked longingly
in that direction, as if there was a wish in his heart
he hardly dared to utter—perhaps a wish that she
was not his employee, but a member of the circle
in which his own pretty and fashionable sisters
moved.</p>

<p>He looked around to note that every one was busy,
even his foreman attending in person to a difficult
job of gilding on Turkey morocco.</p>

<p>Then he moved very quietly toward the little
screened-off space where our heroine was at work,
and approached her so silently that not until he
spoke was she aware of his close vicinity.</p>

<p>“Is this work difficult, Miss Hattie?” he asked, in
a low, kind tone.</p>

<p>A start, a blush, which made her generally pale
face almost glorious in color, showed her surprise,
but her dark eyes were calm and steady as she
looked up at him, and replied:</p>

<p>“Not difficult, but a little perplexing, Mr. W——,
in consequence of the scattered condition of the
pages. Those old magazines, all torn apart, were
mixed up without regard to number or date, and
you must excuse me if I seem to work slow. I have
to read sometimes half a page before I can decide
where it belongs.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[39]</span></p>

<p>“Take your own time, Miss Hattie, and make no
more haste than justice to your work demands.
You have never found me a very hard task-master,
I hope.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, sir. I believe all in the bindery
look upon you as a kind employer.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Miss Hattie. I trust they will long
continue to consider me so. By the way, are you
sufficiently isolated here to pursue your difficult duties—or
would you prefer a corner in the office?”</p>

<p>“I would prefer to remain here, Mr. W——. Any
extra kindness to me will only cause others to feel
envious, and I do not wish to make enemies.”</p>

<p>“Enemies! Just as if it were possible for you to
make enemies. Have no fear on that score, Miss
Hattie. But when I can in any way render your
position more comfortable, Miss Hattie, please inform
me.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” she said, bending again to her
work.</p>

<p>He cast one long, lingering look at that graceful
form bowed forward over those old musty pages,
and turned away with a half-smothered sigh.</p>

<p>“It is a wonder that I never noticed before how
exquisitely beautiful she is,” he murmured to himself,
as he passed on and into his office. “Her voice
is music mellowed down. Her language so chaste
and well chosen. Ah, me! I do not wonder young
Legare feared his father might fall in love with
such a prodigy. I fear I shall myself. And if I did,
what would my sisters say?”</p>

<p>Yes, that is a man’s question all over. They see a
lovely face and form—all the heart they have is
moved by it. But they ask not “is she good? Is her
disposition sweet? Is she pure and stainless?” Only<span class="pagenum">[40]</span>
this—“is she rich in worldly lucre? Is she one who
can move a star in the fashionable world? Will she
be an ornament in my circle of society?”</p>

<p>What ganders men are. There, I’ve said it, and
I mean it.</p>

<p>Hattie paused over her work when the footsteps of
her employer died away on her ear. He had not before
spoken to her a dozen times in the two years or
more of her employment there. His orders and directions
always came through the foreman hitherto;
and when he spoke to a hand he was not in the habit
of using a prefix to the name of that hand. To her
he had said Miss Hattie. The foreman always called
her Hattie—nothing more—and she was used to it.
Some girls would have been pleased at this mark of
preference. Not so our heroine. She knew enough
of the cold heartlessness of the world to look with
distrust upon any advances made by those who
were above her in position or fortune.</p>

<p>A sigh broke from her lips, and she almost wished
she was back at her sewing-bench at four dollars a
week, with no one aware of her talents as a linguist;
though her advanced wages would add
much to her comfort and enable her to add to her
small savings.</p>

<p>She bent again to her labor, and sought in it and
its perplexities, refuge from all other thoughts, and
she had indeed enough to think of in setting those
mixed up pages right. No one else in the bindery
could have done it. It was a job which the foreman
had laid aside as hopeless, until the late discovery
of her talent.</p>

<p>And now he came to her to see how she was getting
forward. In reply to his question she said:</p>

<p>“One volume is there, sir, with every page in its<span class="pagenum">[41]</span>
place, and ready for the sewing-bench. It is slow
work, for the pages are badly mixed and torn up.
But I am doing it as fast as I can.”</p>

<p>“Fast enough, in all reason, Hattie,” said Mr.
Jones. “You are on wages—or salary, rather, now,
and not on piece work. So you need not drive yourself.”</p>

<p>“Salary will make no difference in my industry,
Mr. Jones. I shall ever strive my best to devote
every moment of working time to the benefit of my
employers.”</p>

<p>“It’s a good principle, Hattie, and I know you live
up to it, which is more than can be said of a great
many in the shop. I’ll put this volume in the sewer’s
hands. Do the rest in your own time. It is a job I
never expected to carry through. It has been laying
here over a year untouched. When you get it done,
I have three or four more almost as bad.”</p>

<p>Hattie bowed her head, but made no reply. The
foreman had never been quite so talkative or complacent
before. He was generally stern, sharp, and
imperative with all under him.</p>

<p>When he went away she murmured to herself:</p>

<p>“What can all this mean? Mr. Jones has softened
in his tone. It used to be ‘hurry up, Hattie, hurry
up; we can’t have no lazing ’round in this shop!’
Now, when my wages are nearly treble, and it
should be expected I should exert myself all the
more, I am told to take my time. Ah, me! I hope
no clouds will come to cover this sudden gleam of
sunshine.”</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">“LIZZIE, I’VE SEEN HER!”</span></h2>
</div>


<p>And young Legare heaved a great sigh when he
confronted his sister with this declaration on his
lips.</p>

<p>“Who—Frank—who?” asked Miss Legare, looking
up from a book of fashion plates which were
engrossing her attention as he entered her special
sitting-room, or boudoir, as she termed it.</p>

<p>For she had been educated at Vassar, and could
not descend to ordinary terms.</p>

<p>“Who? Just as if you did not remember my errand
down town. I have been to W——’s bindery.”</p>

<p>“Oh! that bindery girl!”</p>

<p>“Yes—the bindery girl!”</p>

<p>“Well! Why don’t you report? What do you
want to keep me in suspense for?” cried the spoiled
pet of fortune.</p>

<p>“She is very beautiful. The prettiest girl, in face
and form, that I have ever seen in all my life.”</p>

<p>And Frank gulped down a sigh.</p>

<p>“A bindery girl, smelling of sour paste and leather—beautiful!
Oh, Frank, I thought you had some
taste, some knowledge of refinement.”</p>

<p>“I hope I have, sister mine. If you had hands as
small and white, and fingers that tapered down to
the rosy nails as do hers, you would throw off your
half-dozen diamond rings and let your hand speak
for itself. And such a form—not made up, but fresh
from nature’s choicest mold.”</p>

<p>“You, Frank! You traitor!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Lizzie?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[43]</span></p>

<p>“You went down there to see that your father was
not snared by that siren—to have her discharged,
sent away. Have you done it?”</p>

<p>“No, Lizzie, there is no cause for her discharge,
and Mr. W—— laughed at the idea. Father did not
exchange twenty words with her, and they were
purely on business, and in Mr. W——’s presence.”</p>

<p>“How many words have you exchanged with this
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ne plus ultra</i> of loveliness?”</p>

<p>“Not one. I got but one look in her face, one
glance from her bewildering eye, yet the memory of
both will dwell in my heart while I live.”</p>

<p>“In short, Frank, you went there to save papa
from a snare, and are yourself a victim. I see
through it all. I have got to take this matter in
hand. You men with susceptible hearts are just good
for nothing.”</p>

<p>“You had better not meddle in the matter, sister
dear. I do not think our father is in danger, at present,
at any rate.”</p>

<p>“Well, if papa isn’t, Brother Frank is. So I’m
going to get that dangerously beautiful girl out of
the way. I’ll do it if I have to make love to Mr.
W—— himself, to get him to discharge her.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think he’d look at you, after seeing her.”</p>

<p>“Frank, this is a downright insult. Comparing a
Legare to a poor bindery girl.”</p>

<p>“Sister, I did not mean it as such. But in sober
earnest I do believe that Mr. W—— is in love with
this paragon himself.”</p>

<p>“Poh! Because you are a fool, do not think every
one is like you.”</p>

<p>“You are strangely complimentary, Miss Legare.”</p>

<p>“Not more so than the object of my compliments<span class="pagenum">[44]</span>
deserves, Mr. Legare,” said the sister, snappishly.</p>

<p>“Good-morning. I will go to my club. There, at
least, I will be treated as a gentleman!” cried the
brother, rising.</p>

<p>“Frank, you’re a brute!”</p>

<p>And Lizzie burst out in a flood of tears.</p>

<p>Frank turned back, though he had reached the
door.</p>

<p>“Darling, do not weep or quarrel with a brother
who loves you better than he loves his life!” he
whispered, as he bent tenderly over her.</p>

<p>“Then don’t—don’t talk so to a sister who loves
you with all her heart and soul!” sobbed Lizzie,
looking forgiveness through her tears—sunlight
breaking through the clouds—“dear brother!”</p>

<p>And clinging to his neck, she kissed him with almost
childish fervor and tenderness.</p>

<p>The storm was over. Would that all such domestic
storms could pass as fleetly, and as brightly.</p>

<p>Frank did not go to his club. He sat down by the
side of his sister, and long, earnestly and quietly
they talked about this strangely beautiful, this
mysterious girl, and tried to plan out some way to
find out, without her knowing it, who she was,
where she came from, and all about her.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">MISS SCRIMP’S CURIOSITY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Little Jessie Albemarle always had the door-bell
to answer, even if she was making beds in the top
story of the house, when she heard it, for Miss
Scrimp considered it beneath her dignity to go to
the door when she was able to keep a cook and a
house-servant. Moreover, she was seldom dressed
for appearance at the door except when ready to go
to market or the time arrived when she could watch
her hungry boarders from the accustomed seat at
the head of the long table in her dining-room.</p>

<p>And Jessie heard a sharp, sudden ring thrice repeated,
only a week later than when she had answered
the postman’s ring before for Hattie Butler’s
California letter, and she knew by the peculiar
ring who was there. She bounded down stairs two
or three steps at a jump, and passed Miss Scrimp on
the landing at the head of the first stairs where she
usually posted herself to listen when any one came
to the door.</p>

<p>The postman handed her a letter, and Jessie, at a
glance, saw that it was for Miss Hattie Butler—was
postmarked in California and sealed with red wax
with that strange device—two hearts pierced with
an arrow.</p>

<p>Scarcely was the door shut when Miss Scrimp
screamed out, in her usual shrill tone:</p>

<p>“You, Jess! who is that letter for?”</p>

<p>“Miss Hattie Butler, ma’am,” said Jess, meekly.
“Sha’n’t I keep it and give it to her when she
comes?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[46]</span></p>

<p>“No, bring it here this minute!”</p>

<p>Jess went slowly up stairs, and reluctantly handed
the letter over to her mistress. She had given her
letters before, which she knew never reached those
to whom they were directed. And the poor little servant
loved Hattie Butler, and could not bear that
she should be wronged.</p>

<p>Miss Scrimp looked at her letter.</p>

<p>“It’s from Californy again,” she muttered.
“There’s somethin’ strange in so many letters
comin’ to that gal from Californy.” Then she turned
to Jessie, and fixing, if she could fix, those cross-eyes
on her, she said, in a whisper, a harsh, fierce whisper:
“If you just breathe one whisper to a living
soul about this letter a-comin’ here, I’ll pull the very
ears off your frowsy head. I’m afeared some one is
a-tryin’ to delude that sweet young cretur away,
and I’m not a-goin’ to sit still and see it. No, it’s my
Christian duty to take care of her, and I’m goin’ to
do it. I’ll see who it is a-writin’ to her, and what
he says.”</p>

<p>“Why, sure, ma’am, you wouldn’t keep Miss Hattie’s
own letter from her?” asked Jessie, with unusual
boldness.</p>

<p>“Yes, for her own good, I would. And now, mind
you, don’t speak it to a living soul. If you do, I’ll
whip you till you can’t squeal!”</p>

<p>Miss Scrimp was one who never forgot such a
promise, as poor Jessie knew to her sorrow. So she
went back up stairs to her work, and Miss Scrimp
darted into her own room with that letter.</p>

<p>She sat down near the dingy window, and looked
at it, back and front, and examined it in every way
to see if it was not possible to open it without breaking
the seal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[47]</span></p>

<p>But this could not be done. The seal must be
broken, or the end of the envelope cut. Miss Scrimp
hesitated before acting on either of these ideas. She
had heard of a penalty attached to the crime of
opening another person’s letter.</p>

<p>She didn’t care a pin for the crime, but she did
care for the penalty. She was like the penitent
thief. He was sorry to be caught stealing.</p>

<p>“I must know what is in this letter!” she muttered.
“I can’t understand that girl. And she will
never tell me anything. There’s a mystery about
her, and for the life of me I can’t get at the bottom
of it. But I will—I will, if I die for it. Jess will
never dare tell her about this letter. I’d skin her
alive if she did. I’ll open it, and know who she has
got in Californy, and what he wants.”</p>

<p>With a desperate twitch she ran her dirty thumb-nail
under the crease of the envelope, near the end
of the letter, tore it open, and took out a half sheet
of note-paper.</p>

<p>It had neither date nor place of dating at its
head. The letter was composed of but two lines.
She read them over aloud:</p>

<p class="center">“My darling, every pledge is kept. Wealth is
gained. Let me come to you!”</p>

<p>There was no signature—not a clew. The handwriting
was elegant, but even the sex of the writer
could not be determined by that.</p>

<p>If ever a woman was madly disappointed, that
woman was Miss Scrimp.</p>

<p>Literally she had run all her risk for nothing. And
her curiosity now was excited a thousandfold.
What pledges had been kept by the one who dare
call Hattie Butler darling? Wealth had been<span class="pagenum">[48]</span>
gained, but whose was it? That the writer
wanted to come to Hattie was certain. But who
was that writer? Miss Scrimp would have given
her false hair and teeth to know. Yes, or she
would have fed her boarders on turkey for a week
if she could have gotten old and tough ones at half
price.</p>

<p>If she had only known who to write to, or even to
telegraph to, an answer would have gone back,
signed: “Come along soon as you can—Hattie Butler.”</p>

<p>But Hattie would not have known it. Miss Scrimp,
mean as she was, would have spent five dollars
for telegraphing in a moment if she could by that
have got to the bottom of the mystery which so terribly
worried her.</p>

<p>Little did she dream, while in this turmoil of disappointment,
that a pair of gleeful eyes were fairly
dancing over her too evident annoyance; for Jessie
Albemarle, after going noisily up stairs, as if to her
work, had crept down as slyly as a mouse, and peeping
through the key-hole, had been a witness to the
opening of the letter.</p>

<p>And when she saw Miss Scrimp put the letter
under a book on a shelf near her bed, the brave little
friend of Hattie Butler determined that, even
though the seal was broken, the letter should reach
its proper owner.</p>

<p>“She’ll go down to cut their slices of bread and
meat for supper, and then I’ll get it,” said Jessie to
herself. “She will never let me cut the bread or
meat for fear I’ll cut too thick, or maybe eat a bite
or two while I’m cutting ’em. But Miss Hattie is so
good to me that I will help her, and she shall have
her letter whether I get whipped for it or not.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[49]</span></p>

<p>And the little heroine went back to her work as
silently as she had left it, with her little plan fully
arranged.</p>

<p>And Miss Scrimp, having hidden the letter, was
pondering in perplexity over its meaning. She had
been often exercised over the secrets of her boarders,
but never so badly as now.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum">[50]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">DETECTED.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Miss Scrimp was unusually cross that night at the
supper table. There was less than the usual quantity
of thin-sliced bread and butter on the table. The
butter, ever scanty, was less by two plates, and the
crackers altogether missing. When the boarders answered
the cracked bell, and Hattie Butler took her
usual seat close on her right, Miss Scrimp quite forgot
to say, as she generally did, “good-evening,
dear.”</p>

<p>Miss Scrimp was all out of sorts, and she evidently
didn’t care who knew it—or, perhaps, meant they
all should know it. One of the girls, Wild Kate, the
rest called her, she was ever so odd, willful, and
daring, happened to ask why the table was like a
worn-out whip-lash, and as no one could respond to
the conundrum, she gave the solution herself. She
said there was no cracker on it.</p>

<p>“There’s no need of crackers when such snappish
things are around as you are!” shrieked Miss
Scrimp.</p>

<p>“This butter was made from milk that came from
a very old cow. I’ve found three gray hairs in a
very small piece, just enough to match the wafer-like
thickness of this stale bread,” said Kate, never
at a loss for a venomous reply when attacked by
Miss Scrimp.</p>

<p>“Them that doesn’t like what I set before ’em can
go farther and maybe fare worse,” snarled Miss
Scrimp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[51]</span></p>

<p>As half the girls were tittering over the points
Kate had made, the latter was satisfied for the time,
and Miss Scrimp’s last fling fell on heedless ears.</p>

<p>In a little time the table was literally cleared, for
girls who have toiled all day, with but a slender,
cold lunch for dinner, cannot but be hungry at
night.</p>

<p>When the table was deserted poor Jessie looked
in vain for a scrap for her supper. Miss Scrimp saw
it, but she felt too cross and ugly to care, and so poor
Jessie went without any supper, while Biddy Lanigan
and her mistress, as usual, had their strong tea
and extra dishes.</p>

<p>“Never mind, I’ve got Miss Hattie’s letter in my
bosom, and I’ll tell all about the old cat, and how
she opened it, and what she threatened to do to me
if I told.”</p>

<p>And this revenge in prospect satisfied poor Jessie
better than a good supper would have done.</p>

<p>She could hardly wait to help clear up the table
and wash the dishes, so eager was she to get up to
Hattie’s room. But the work was done at last, and
Jessie, after her usual round of abuse from Biddy
Lanigan, was sent off to bed, with orders to be astir
before daylight, and ready to go to market.</p>

<p>Now was her chance to see Hattie, for she had to
pass Hattie’s room on her way to the miserable
closet in the attic loft, where she slept.</p>

<p>A trembling rap on the door of Hattie’s bedroom
elicited a response in the sweet, low voice of the
bindery girl.</p>

<p>“Come in! Why, Little Jessie, is it you? Come
in, dear, I have a nice bit of cake for you that I
bought as I was coming home.”</p>

<p>“Dear Miss Hattie, I thank you ever so much, but<span class="pagenum">[52]</span>
I’m not hungry, though I haven’t had any supper.
I’ve so much to tell you. Here is a letter the postman
brought to-day!”</p>

<p>And Jessie took the torn and crumpled letter
from its hiding-place in the bosom of her ragged
dress.</p>

<p>“Why, Jessie, it has been opened!” exclaimed
Hattie, in surprise, and an angry flush overspread
her face.</p>

<p>“Yes, Miss Hattie, and I went in and got it where
it had been hidden, or you would never have seen
it!” said Jessie, “and if I am whipped to death for
it, I’ll tell you all about it.”</p>

<p>And bravely the poor little bound girl told the
whole story, even as we already know it.</p>

<p>“The cowardly, meddling, contemptible wretch!”
was a very natural ejaculation, and it came from
Hattie’s lips.</p>

<p>But when she read the brief letter, and saw that
neither place, date, address nor signature was inside,
a gleam of satisfaction took place of the shadow
on her face.</p>

<p>“Miss Scrimp has gained nothing by her audacious
act,” she said. “But it is necessary that I should
teach her a lesson. I will write a note to her, which
you will take down to her. Leave it on her table,
and instantly go to your own room. If I need you I
will call you.”</p>

<p>“And you will not let her whip me, will you, Miss
Hattie?”</p>

<p>“No, Jessie. If she but offers to raise a finger to
you, or speaks even an unkind word to you for what
you have done for me, I will send her to prison for
what she has done. Have no fear, my poor little
dear. I will protect you, and see that hereafter you<span class="pagenum">[53]</span>
are better treated than you have ever been before
in this house. And soon you shall tell me all you
know about yourself, as you promised me once you
would, and perhaps if you have parents living I can
help you to find them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Hattie if ever there was an angel on
earth you’re that one,” said Jessie, trembling all
over with joy.</p>

<p>Hattie turned to her table, and wrote in a plain,
but elegant hand, these words on a slip of paper:</p>

<p class="center">“Miss Hattie Butler desires to see Miss Scrimp in
her room up stairs immediately on very important
business.”</p>

<p>“Now take the cake I got for you, and put it in
your pocket to eat when you get to your own room,
and then take this note and lay it on Miss Scrimp’s
table, and come right away before she can call you
back to question you,” said Hattie.</p>

<p>“Please, Miss Hattie, I haven’t got any pockets in
my dress. Miss Scrimp wouldn’t let me have any
pockets in ’em for fear I’d put in crackers or something
when I’m hungry, and that is very often.”</p>

<p>“Then run and put it under your pillow before
you go down stairs,” said Hattie, smiling.</p>

<p>“Please, there’s no pillow to my bed. But I’ll hide
it among the rags there, and eat it so thankfully,
for I am real hungry, since I told you what Miss
Scrimp did and how I saw it.”</p>

<p>And Jessie went and hid the cake, which was to
be her only supper, and then quickly returned for
the note.</p>

<p>She ran down stairs light as a kitten, and finding
Miss Scrimp’s door ajar looked in and saw that lady—pardon
the name—busy over the book in which she
kept her boarding accounts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[54]</span></p>

<p>Jessie slipped in, dropped the paper over Miss
Scrimp’s shoulder on the table, and was out of the
room so quickly that Miss Scrimp did not know who
brought the note.</p>

<p>But she trembled and turned pale when she read
it.</p>

<p>“I wonder if that little brat of a bound girl has
dared to tell her about the letter?” she ejaculated.
“No,” she continued, “it can’t be that. Jess knows
I’d skin her alive if she told, and she’d bite her
tongue off first. I’ll bet Miss Hattie wants to take a
room lower down, now that she is getting more than
twice as much money a week as any other girl in
the house gets. That’s it; I’ll go right up. She is
real good pay, always cash down the day it is due,
and no grumbling. I’ll give her the best room in the
house, and turn that saucy Kate Marmont away, if
she objects to giving it up. I wish I’d set Biddy
Lanigan a-going at her to-night; she would have
wished the gray hairs in her butter had got cross
ways in her throat before she talked about ’em.”</p>

<p>And Miss Scrimp closed up her old account book,
took up her hand-lamp, and started up the steep,
narrow, and dirty stairs toward Hattie Butler’s
room. She had been so surprised that she had not
even asked herself who could have left the note,
nor even thought how it came floating down on her
table.</p>

<p>Almost breathless, she reached the landing in
front of Hattie’s room, and knocked at the door.</p>

<p>“Come in,” said Hattie, in a clear, distinct tone.</p>

<p>Hattie was sitting on her bed; her only chair was
between her and the door, near the table, and when
Miss Scrimp took the seat Hattie pointed to, the<span class="pagenum">[55]</span>
lamp-light from both her lamp and Hattie’s on the
table, fell strong on her angular, ugly face.</p>

<p>“I got your note, and came up quick as I could,
dear,” said Miss Scrimp, the moment she could
gather breath enough to speak.</p>

<p>For the long, steep stairs tired her very severely.</p>

<p>“I suppose you’ve made up your mind to change
your room and something better, now you’re
making ever so much money—eh, dear?” continued
Miss Scrimp.</p>

<p>“No, my business with you is of more importance
than a change of rooms. It may cause a change of
residence for you, Miss Scrimp.”</p>

<p>“For me?” cried the ancient maiden, turning
whiter than the pillow-case on which Hattie rested
her hand. “I can’t understand you, dear.”</p>

<p>“I will try to make my meaning quite plain before
this interview is over, Miss Scrimp. Did the postman
leave a letter here for me to-day?”</p>

<p>“The postman!” fairly gasped Miss Scrimp, her
eyes a pale green, her face ghastly in its hue. “I
haven’t seen the postman to-day!”</p>

<p>“No matter whether you saw him or not. I ask a
plain question in plain words. Did the postman
leave a letter here for me to-day?”</p>

<p>Miss Scrimp determined to brazen the matter
right out.</p>

<p>“If he did he didn’t leave it with me. And if that’s
all you’ve made me climb them dreadful stairs for I
don’t thank you. So now!”</p>

<p>“Be a little cautious and a trifle more respectful,
Miss Scrimp!” said Hattie sternly.</p>

<p>“Respectful? Suppose I ought to be to the cheapest
boarder I’ve got in the house. I’m not going to
stay here to be insulted by a bindery girl.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[56]</span></p>

<p>And the angry spinster arose, and with her lamp
in her hand started for the door.</p>

<p>“Stop! Come back and sit down, or I will go for a
police officer and have you arrested for an offense
which will land you in the State prison!” cried Hattie.</p>

<p>“Police officer—arrest me?” gasped Miss Scrimp.</p>

<p>But she came back, put her lamp on the table, and
sat down.</p>

<p>“Now tell me what you want. Don’t try to scare
a poor, nervous old creetur like me—please don’t,
Miss Hattie.”</p>

<p>“I want the letter I know was brought to this
house by the regular letter carrier to-day!”</p>

<p>“Dear me, Miss Hattie, I’ve told you again and
again I haven’t seen any letter-carrier to-day.”</p>

<p>“Nor any letter for me, Miss Scrimp?”</p>

<p>“I vow to goodness, no!”</p>

<p>“Will you swear on the Bible you have not had a
letter for me in your possession to-day, Miss
Scrimp?”</p>

<p>And Hattie reached beneath her pillow for the
Sacred Book, which she ever read for a few minutes
each night before she closed her eyes in sleep.</p>

<p>“You’ve no right to make me swear. I’ve told
you I haven’t seen no letter of yours, Miss Hattie,
and that ought to satisfy you.”</p>

<p>“But it does not, Miss Scrimp. Your hesitation, if
I had no other proof, would condemn you. Now I
know you had a letter of mine in your hands to-day,
and I want it.”</p>

<p>“I hain’t got any letter of yours to give you.”</p>

<p>“Then you will force me to get an officer and
have you arrested. I would have saved you the disgrace
if I could, but since you are obstinate I will<span class="pagenum">[57]</span>
let the law take its course. You can go to your room.
I will go for an officer.”</p>

<p>“Dear me, maybe some one has laid a letter for
you down in my room. If they have, I’ll go and
bring it to you,” said Miss Scrimp, now thoroughly
frightened by the determined air and spirit of our
heroine.</p>

<p>“Go, then, and look for it,” said Hattie. “But
remember, Miss Scrimp, if you are not here with the
letter in just ten minutes, I will wait no longer. I
will not have my letters tampered with when the
law protects me in my rights.”</p>

<p>“I’ll find—I’m sure I’ll find it,” gasped the trembling
spinster, and she tottered to the door and went
down stairs, shaking from head to foot, leaving the
door open in her haste.</p>

<p>“May I come in just one second?” asked Little Jessie,
who now showed herself at the door, with her
cake, half gone, in her hand.</p>

<p>“No, dear, not till I am through with her,” said
Hattie. “I don’t want her to see you, or ever know
how I found my letter, if I can help it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, wasn’t it fun to see her turn white and green
and shake all over?” said Jessie. “This cake is just
awful good, Miss Hattie, but I’d go hungry to bed
every night of my life just to see that old heathen
get such a scare.”</p>

<p>“There, there, run to your room, like a good, dear
Little Jess,” cried Hattie. “I hear the old thing
shuffling up stairs again. I’ll see what new device
she offers to stave off her fate, and then, as the soldiers
say, I’ll unmask my battery.”</p>

<p>Little Jessie vanished, and only just in time, for,
wheezing and puffing like a sick cat, Miss Scrimp<span class="pagenum">[58]</span>
came up the stairs, and with a face of an ashen hue,
entered the room.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">WILL SHE KEEP HER PROMISES?</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“I couldn’t find the letter nowhere, Miss Hattie.
I must have been mistaken,” whined Miss Scrimp.
“And I’ve dragged my poor old bones all the way
up these dreadful stairs again to tell you so.”</p>

<p>“Did you look on the shelf above your bed, where
you laid it after opening and reading it?” asked
Hattie, very quietly, but with her dark eyes fixed
on the ashen face of the old vixen.</p>

<p>“What?” almost screamed Miss Scrimp. “Do you
accuse me of opening one of your letters?”</p>

<p>“Yes—I do. There were two witnesses to the
act.”</p>

<p>“It’s a lie! There wasn’t a single one beside me
in the room,” yelled Miss Scrimp, wild and desperate.
“No one could have seen me do it.”</p>

<p>“Three witnesses, since you have turned State’s
evidence, and confessed it!” said Hattie, so provokingly
quiet.</p>

<p>“I didn’t confess. I only said no one saw me do it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, there did—and I will be able to prove it
before the magistrate when I have you arrested. If
you had confessed your fault at once I might have
excused your criminal curiosity, and forgiven you in
the hope that hereafter you would be a wiser and a
better woman. But since you deny your guilt I
may as well prove it and have you punished. Inside
the walls of a prison you may have time to reflect
on the manner in which you have treated poor<span class="pagenum">[59]</span>
girls who were in your power. You will get better
board there than your boarders get here.”</p>

<p>“In prison?” gasped Miss Scrimp.</p>

<p>“Yes, in prison, where you will be sent for breaking
the seal of my letter.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t break the seal—I only tore it open at
the end!” whined the wretched culprit.</p>

<p>“With your thumb-nail. No matter where or how
you opened my private letter after taking it from
the hands of your servant, who received it from the
postman.”</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s where you found it out? Little Jess
has told on me. Oh, but I’ll skin her for it. I’ll
scratch her brown eyes out! I’ll——”</p>

<p>“Hush, Miss Scrimp. You will not in any way
dare to injure the poor girl. I have not said she was
a witness. I have said there were at first two witnesses—you,
in your own confession, make the
third. I need no more. You can go to your room,
while I put on my things and go for an officer.”</p>

<p>“Oh, mercy!” screamed Miss Scrimp, “don’t have
me arrested. I did do it. I did read the letter.
There were only two lines of reading in it, and I
couldn’t make nothin’ out o’ them. Oh, dear, dear,
it will be the ruin of me—the everlastin’ ruin. Oh,
do have mercy on a poor creetur’ that has always
been as good to you as she knew how.”</p>

<p>And Miss Scrimp threw herself on her knees on
the bare, uncarpeted floor, and with tears streaming
down her sallow cheeks, looked in agony on the girl
who held her at her mercy.</p>

<p>“Some one has stolen the letter off my shelf,
where I hid it,” she moaned. “If they hadn’t I
would have brought it right up to you. Oh, do pity
me, Miss Hattie. I was so put out ’cause I couldn’t<span class="pagenum">[60]</span>
find out who was a writin’ to you from Californy.
Do forgive me; I’ll never, never do so again.”</p>

<p>“Get up and sit down,” said Hattie. “Never kneel
except to the Father above, and of Him ask forgiveness.
If I should abstain from arresting you for this
crime you must promise me several things and keep
your promises, too, or I shall not keep mine. And
you must answer several questions truly. On yourself
now will depend my action.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll promise anything, and keep it, too, and
I’ll answer all you ask, if you’ll only not have me
arrested. I know I did wrong, I knew it all the time
I was doing it, but it seemed as if I couldn’t help it.”</p>

<p>“Promise me from this time on to treat poor Jessie
Albemarle kindly, never to whip her, never even
to scold her without she is at fault,” said Hattie.</p>

<p>“I promise,” sobbed Miss Scrimp.</p>

<p>“And promise if one of the poor girls, or any of
them, are taken sick, not to treat her or them inhumanly,
and send them off to suffer, but to wait
till they can recover and pay for their board and
nursing.”</p>

<p>“I promise,” gasped Miss Scrimp.</p>

<p>“Next, I want you to put enough on the table for
your boarders to eat, so that they need not arise
from the table hungry.”</p>

<p>“It’ll ruin me, but I’ll do it,” moaned the hapless
woman, fairly writhing at the thought.</p>

<p>“I will ask no more promises now. If you keep
what you have made you will have no cause to regret
it. But there are a few questions for you to
answer. You have got Jessie Albemarle bound out
to you till she reaches the age of eighteen?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I got her from the asylum.”</p>

<p>“What do you know about her parentage?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[61]</span></p>

<p>“Nothing, for sure, except what they told me at
the asylum. They said she was left there a baby,
in nice clothes, with a lot of fine things in a basket.
There was a gold necklace around her neck, and on
the clasp the name, Jessie Albemarle, and in the
basket a note asking she might be kept tenderly,
for some day she’d be called for. And they kept her
there, and taught her readin’, and writin’, and
’rithmetic, and all that, till she was over twelve
years old, and then I got her. She hasn’t growed a
bit since, though she is over fifteen now.”</p>

<p>“No wonder, for you have starved and worked
her almost to death. But this cruelty shall go no
farther; henceforth she shall be treated at least like
a human being.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Hattie, aren’t you going to have any
mercy on me?”</p>

<p>“All, and even more than you deserve, Miss
Scrimp. But I am not done with my questions yet.
A lady called here not long ago to ask after Jessie
Albemarle?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I told her she had run away. I didn’t
know where she was.”</p>

<p>“What did you do it for?”</p>

<p>“I was afraid it was the girl’s mother, and I’d lose
Jess, when I need her so much.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you heartless creature! What did the lady
say?”</p>

<p>“She cried and took on terrible, but I didn’t let
her into the house fer fear she’d see Jess. I happened
by good luck to be at the door when she came.
She was a grand looking lady, with diamonds in her
ears and on her fingers.”</p>

<p>“Was that the last you heard of it?”</p>

<p>“No, they sent for me down to the asylum, and I<span class="pagenum">[62]</span>
told ’em the same story. I said Jess had run away.”</p>

<p>“That makes another fraud, Miss Scrimp, for
which you could be arrested and punished.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me! You’ll not have me arrested for
what I tell you, when I only answer the questions
you force on me.”</p>

<p>“It depends entirely on yourself now. Treat Jessie
kindly, set a good fair table. I ask no luxuries,
only that you have enough for all, and you are safe
from the arrest which I can and will have made if
you break a single promise.”</p>

<p>“I’ll keep my word if it just ruins me,” sighed
Miss Scrimp. “And now, Miss Hattie, please, please
do me one favor.”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“Tell me who is it that is writin’ to you from
Californy. I’m just dyin’ to know.”</p>

<p>“I cannot tell you at present,” said Hattie. “The
time may not be far distant when I shall make no
secret of it to you or any one else. Now you can go.”</p>

<p>“Thankee, Miss Hattie. I’ll live in hopes. But I’d
give anything to know now.”</p>

<p>Hattie made no answer, and Miss Scrimp took up
her lamp and crept down stairs again to mourn
over the change that had got to come in her household.</p>

<p>And Hattie, delighted at her victory, pondered
over a new thought. How would she go to work to
discover if the lady who had called was really the
mother of Little Jessie, and if so, how could she inform
her that her child was alive and needful of a
mother’s care and love?</p>

<p>“It can only be done by advertising, and I will do
it,” said Hattie, after she had thought over it a
while.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[63]</span></p>

<p>Then she took the crumpled letter of two lines
only, and looked at it over and over again, with
tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh, Father in Heaven, guide me!” she said.
“Dare I trust him now? Has he surely conquered
that fearful appetite or passion which drags so
many noble souls down to death and perdition?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">“IT IS A GEM!” HE CRIED.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Mr. Legare sat in his magnificent library, talking
with Frank and Lizzie, his only children. Where
the large room was not lined with book-cases filled
from ceiling to floor with choice works, paintings
by the masters of art filled every space.</p>

<p>To a scholar and an artist that library would
seem a fairy region where taste and fancy, roaming
hand in hand, could live forever. And Mr. Legare
had tastes which fed on the artistic beauty of
his paintings, and enjoyed the worth of his valuable
books. He had tried to rear his children to the
same taste, to similar noble and improving studies.
But he had also, with his almost unlimited wealth,
given them access to all fashionable pleasures, and
the consequence was that both son and daughter
found more pleasure in the outside world than in
the solid realities of their palace-like home. The
opera and its circle of fashion, theatrical spectacles,
not the grand old plays of Shakespeare, balls,
routes, and club pastimes suited them far better
than to gaze on those noble works of art, or pore
over the grand array of books which filled the hundreds
of shelves in the best private library in the
great city.</p>

<p>Mr. Legare was looking over his last acquisition,
the rare old reviews, beautifully bound, which had
just been sent in from Mr. W——’s book-bindery.
The work was, as usual with that establishment,
elegantly done; but Mr. Legare was intently looking<span class="pagenum">[65]</span>
over the inside of the works, while Frank and
Lizzie were looking over a new collection of fine
English prints, which had just been received from
London, and were now spread out on the mosaic
table-center.</p>

<p>Suddenly an exclamation of surprise and pleasure
broke from the old gentleman’s lips.</p>

<p>“Wonderful! It is a gem! and it illustrates the
subject perfectly!” he cried.</p>

<p>“What is it that pleases you so, papa?” asked the
daughter.</p>

<p>“A pencil sketch on the blank leaf of this old review.
It is an illustrated idea of a dream of Martin
Luther—angels poring over the revealed word of
God. It is perfection, and entirely fresh. It must
be the work of that wonderful girl down at W——’s
bindery, for she alone has had the care of this work
since it left my hands, and the drawing was not
there when I took the pages to the bindery. It must
be the work of that wonderfully gifted girl. I’ll
find out, and if it is, she must and shall have a
chance to study art. This sketch would do credit to
a Dore, or any other artist. Come and look at it,
Frank.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, father, I am looking over your new
portfolio, and, moreover, I am no believer in the
wonderful talent of shop-girls. It is very easy, when
so many works are coming and going, to make
copies of sketches. That may be a copy from Dore,
for all you know.”</p>

<p>“Even if copied, none but an artistic hand could
do it so well,” said the old gentleman, his eyes still
lingering over the sketch.</p>

<p>At that moment a tall lady, of middle age, noble<span class="pagenum">[66]</span>
in appearance, and dressed richly, but plainly, and
in excellent taste, entered the room.</p>

<p>Both the young people arose with a glad cry:</p>

<p>“Aunt Louisa, when did you come? Oh, how glad
we are to see you!”</p>

<p>And the old gentleman left his book and its new-found
illustration, to greet the visitor, who, it
seemed, was a widowed sister of his late wife, who,
living in another city, visited him occasionally, and
ever found a welcome, a warm and heartfelt welcome,
from himself and his children.</p>

<p>The children, or rather young people—they were
rather too old to be called children—loved their
Aunt Louisa very much, for she was all tenderness
to them, and though often sad, as if a secret sorrow
lay heavily on her heart, she was ever ready to join
them in any festive movement, any pleasure-giving
excursion, and seemed to strive to be doubly cheerful
to add to their happiness on such occasions.</p>

<p>“I have but just arrived,” she said, “and even left
my trunk at the depot in my haste to see the dear
ones here.”</p>

<p>“I will send George for it right away, dear aunt—give
me the check,” cried Frank.</p>

<p>“And then come here and look at these old works,
Louisa, and a wonderful little pencil sketch I have
just discovered,” said the old gentleman.</p>

<p>The lady handed her nephew the check for her
baggage, and while he went out to send the coachman
after it, she went to the table where Mr. Legare
had been seated, examining the newly-bound works.</p>

<p>“What artist drew that?” she exclaimed, the moment
her eyes fell on the sketch which had so attracted
his attention.</p>

<p>“I am not sure yet,” he answered. “But I believe<span class="pagenum">[67]</span>
it to be the production of a poor girl, whom I found
sewing in a bindery for four dollars a week, and yet
a complete mistress of five different languages—perhaps
more. I see her initials, ‘H. B.’, in one corner
of the sketch.”</p>

<p>“How old is this wonderful girl?” asked the lady,
with an air of sudden interest.</p>

<p>“She may be twenty or even one or two years
older. Not under eighteen, at any rate,” replied the
old gentleman.</p>

<p>“Too old!” sighed the lady to herself, in a sad
whisper.</p>

<p>What she meant we cannot know. Her brother-in-law
did not hear her, or only the sigh, if he did,
and he continued:</p>

<p>“I got the girl promoted as a reader and collator,
and now they give her ten dollars a week for work
on just such jobs as this—arranging and preparing
choice old works like these. W—— had quite a lot
on hand which he could do nothing with until the
talent and education of this girl came into notice almost
by accident. She is a wonder. Louisa—you
are childless—I do wish you would adopt that girl.
She is lovely as a picture.”</p>

<p>Tears came into the hazel eyes of the lady as she
said:</p>

<p>“I fear my heart would not go out to a stranger!”</p>

<p>“You could not help liking this girl. She is so
modest and unobtrusive. Her employer, and the
foreman, under whom she has worked for over two
years, speak in the highest terms of her. She makes
no associates, and for a wonder no enemies, though
she shuns all acquaintance.”</p>

<p>“We shall have to go and see this wonderful girl,
Aunt Louisa,” said Lizzie, rather petulantly. “Papa<span class="pagenum">[68]</span>
is quite carried away with her. He could talk of
nothing else when he came home to lunch on the
day he discovered her.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps we will go to see her some day!” said
her Aunt Louisa, in a kindly tone. “It is not often
we find refinement and the proof of education among
those who toil for their daily bread. No matter how
gifted the toiler may be by nature, he or she has but
little time to improve the gifts of nature.”</p>

<p>“That is only too true!” said Mr. Legare. “And
so much the more it becomes the duty of us, who
have been blessed with wealth, to use that wealth in
helping these rough jewels to see the light. Though
I shall leave my children enough for all proper needs
and uses—enough for them to hold their station in
life and enjoy it—I intend to leave a good bequest
for the purpose of aiding the poor who desire an education
in literature and art. There are so many in
this world who long to rise and cannot, because
they are weighed down by poverty’s cruel load.”</p>

<p>“You are right. A nobler use for surplus wealth
could not be found,” said the lady, warmly. “I am
glad to hear you say this. When I see a man pass
away, leaving millions on millions, only to be increased
by souls as sordid as his own, I think that
he who forgets God’s poor on earth will himself be
unknown in heaven. Good words go a great way,
but good works go ever so much farther.”</p>

<p>“There! Hear that music!” cried Lizzie; “it is
the bell for lunch. Frank will join us at table.
Come, Aunt Louisa—come, papa, dear; I am as
hungry as a——I don’t know what.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A MARKED CHANGE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Ochone! The ould boy has got into the mistress,
to be sure, and all to wanst. Here’s real round
steak, and I’m ordered to broil it nice for the
breakfast, instead of frying it in hog-fat like I used
to; and there’s twice as much as we ever had before.
And she has got fresh bread in the basket! And Little
Jess is cackling round like a pullet after corn,
and the mistress said I wasn’t to spake a cross word
to her. Sure, I belave the worruld is comin’ to an
end. I am to put two cups of ground coffee in the
pot instead of one, and I’m not to water the milk
any more after the milk-man laves it, but take two
quarts instead of one. I do belave the ould maid is
a-goin’ crazy. She looks as if she had been a-cryin’
all night; and there’s that Jess a-settin’ the table,
and a-singin’ like a little canary. I’d like to slap
the jade over; I’d make her sing like a cat with a
basin of hot water on its hide!”</p>

<p>Thus Biddy Lanigan heralded the sudden change
in her department of Miss Scrimp’s boarding-house.
It was evident she did not like it. It gave her a good
deal more work—and hotter work; for the steak,
formerly fried till too hard to be eatable, on the
range, now had to be broiled over hot coals.</p>

<p>“I’ll have a raise o’ wages for this, or I’ll lave,”
she uttered, as she turned the juicy steak. For
she knew how to cook it nicely when it had to be
done. She had ever kept and cooked the best in a
proper way for her mistress and herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[70]</span></p>

<p>At last, early as the hour was, not fairly light outdoors,
the breakfast bell rang, and the girls trooped
into the breakfast room.</p>

<p>How Hattie enjoyed their looks of wonder, and
then their cries of joy.</p>

<p>“Nice steak—so tender and juicy!” cried one.</p>

<p>“Fresh bread and butter! Dear me!” cried
another.</p>

<p>“Oh, such coffee—with real milk in it!” almost
screamed a third.</p>

<p>And merrily, happily, the girls went to work over
those luxuries like a bevy of singing birds in a field
of grain.</p>

<p>Even Miss Scrimp’s face grew softer as she heard
the merry music at her board, though a sigh now
and then told that this extravagance, while it saved
her from a prison cell, was eating vastly into the
profits which she had hitherto made.</p>

<p>Wild Kate, in the exuberance of her feelings over
this change, made a speech. She often did. But
seldom did she make one so much to the point.</p>

<p>“Girls,” said she, “isn’t this just glorious! Over
this cup of nice coffee I feel like weeping, for having
been so saucy to good Miss Scrimp last night.
Over this delicious steak I feel like promising never
to find a fault here again, without real, strong occasion
for it. Over this sweet butter and this fresh,
nice bread, cut thick, I feel like giving thanks both
to Heaven, and to her who has provided such a
splendid table, and to move a vote of thanks from us
all to Miss Scrimp.”</p>

<p>“Thanks! Thanks!” rose from every girl’s lips
at the table.</p>

<p>“Let us also thank Biddy Lanigan for cooking all
these luxuries so nicely!” added Hattie Butler, who<span class="pagenum">[71]</span>
saw the cook standing near the door, in her accustomed
position.</p>

<p>“I knew that angel-born wouldn’t forget ould
Biddy. She has ever the kind word for me!” cried
the happy Lanigan.</p>

<p>“Thanks to Biddy Lanigan, and Little Jess, too,”
shouted Wild Kate, and the cry echoed from one
end of the room to the other.</p>

<p>But the girls had not long to tarry over this new
and joyous scene. They all had to reach their workshops
on time, or be cut short in wages, and soon
they were all speeding away to their various destinations.</p>

<p>And Jessie sat down for the first time in many a
long, sad day to a full, substantial meal, with time
enough allowed her to eat it. And when it was time
to clear up the table and wash the dishes, she went
to her work with a song on her lips and gladness in
her heart. Hitherto sighs and tears had accompanied
her labors.</p>

<p>When Miss Scrimp sat down to her breakfast,
which was no better than the boarders had just enjoyed,
Biddy was the first to speak.</p>

<p>“Worra! but wasn’t I mad with the stame and the
hate when I was a-cookin’ the breakfast sure. But
when I saw how good the girl craythurs felt, and
how thankful they were, sure the mad all went off,
and I felt like I do when the praste hears me at confession
and says it’s all right. ‘Biddy, go along wid
ye, say all your prayers, and be a good woman.’”</p>

<p>“It costs awful,” was all Miss Scrimp said, but
there was a whole volume of misery in the sigh
which followed her words.</p>

<p>“I’ll keep it up if I can,” she continued. “If I
can’t, why I can’t.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[72]</span></p>

<p>“What sot ye to doin’ it?” asked Biddy.</p>

<p>The question confused Miss Scrimp. Not for any
consideration would she have Biddy know the truth.
It would have ruined her in Biddy’s estimation if
the latter had known she had succumbed to the demands
of the cheapest boarder in the house.</p>

<p>“I thought I’d just try a change,” she said. “I’d
got so sick of hearin’ the girls grumble and growl,
I thought I’d see what real good feedin’ would do
with them.”</p>

<p>At that instant Miss Scrimp caught a glimpse of
Jessie Albemarle’s face. The girl hardly dared to,
but she seemed to want to laugh right out; and
from that instant Miss Scrimp knew that Jessie
Albemarle knew why and how the change had come.</p>

<p>And the moment she could get the little girl alone
after breakfast, she said to her, in a kinder tone
than she had ever used to her before:</p>

<p>“Jessie, my dear, if you will keep a close mouth
about all you know you’ll never be sorry for it. I’ll
have a nice cot-bed put up in your room, and you
shall have two new calico frocks, and a good, soft
pair of shoes.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Miss Scrimp. Miss Hattie told me
not to say anything as long as I was treated well,
and you may be sure I’ll mind her. She is the best
friend I ever had.”</p>

<p>Miss Scrimp would really have liked to tear the
poor girl limb from limb, but she dared not even be
cross with her, so, with what she meant for a smile,
she told her to go and do her work, and take her
time about it.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A PROPOSITION.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Mr. W—— was not much surprised, after what
Frank Legare had said, when he received a visit from
the father of that young gentleman, nor astonished
when in the office Mr. Legare asked him if he would
not send for Hattie Butler, for he had a question to
ask her in regard to the book which he held in his
hand, one of those recently bound.</p>

<p>“I hope the book is bound right,” said Mr. W——,
after having told his foreman to send Hattie Butler
to the office.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, it is bound perfectly, and partially illustrated,”
said Mr. Legare, smiling. “I wish to make
inquiry in regard to the illustration.”</p>

<p>The next moment Hattie entered the office, calm,
completely self-possessed and lady-like.</p>

<p>“Mr. Legare wishes to make some inquiry of you,
Miss Hattie,” said Mr. W——. “Take a seat. I
will leave you with him.”</p>

<p>“Not so, my dear sir—remain,” said Mr. Legare,
promptly. “I have no questions to ask of this young
lady which you should not hear. I found a drawing
in this book, and I am very anxious to know who
made the sketch. It is an illustration of Martin Luther’s
Dream.”</p>

<p>A slight flush arose on Hattie’s cheek when he
opened the book and pointed to the pencil sketch.</p>

<p>“I meant no wrong, sir,” she said; “it was a careless
fancy, done in a few moments in our dinner
hour, when we are at rest to eat or exercise as we<span class="pagenum">[74]</span>
please. I had read the dream, had my pencil in my
pocket, saw the blank page, and made the sketch
without a thought that any one would ever notice it.
I often draw little fancies like that when I have
nothing else to do. I have a portfolio of them at
my room.”</p>

<p>“I will buy every one of them at your own price,
young lady. I conceive myself to be a connoisseur
in art, and I assure you that you draw like a master.
You have talent, great talent.”</p>

<p>“Really, sir, I fear you put too high an estimate
on my poor efforts. I once took a few lessons when
I was with my dear mother, but the crabbed Italian
who taught me said my fingers were stiff, and I had
no eye for lines of grace.”</p>

<p>“He was a fool. Those angels almost speak in
real life-likeness. I must see your portfolio and have
the first privilege of purchasing if any or all of your
drawings are for sale.”</p>

<p>“I hardly think, sir, they are of any value. But I
will bring my portfolio here to-morrow, and leave it
with Mr. W——, so that you can look it through at
your leisure.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. You are very kind.”</p>

<p>“Have you anything further to say, sir? I am in
a hurry; a part of the work I am now collating is
on the sewing-bench, and the sewers will want the
rest.”</p>

<p>“Nothing further,” answered Mr. Legare, and
Hattie hurried away to her work, doubtless pleased
to know that another of her talents had become
known and appreciated.</p>

<p>“Have you never discovered that girl’s wonderful
talent with the pencil before, Mr. W——?” asked
the man of wealth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[75]</span></p>

<p>“Never, sir; it is as great a surprise to me to-day
as our mutual discovery of her proficiency in languages.”</p>

<p>“She is a wonderful girl.”</p>

<p>“A perfect mystery, sir—a perfect mystery. That
she is a born lady, looks, actions, language, all testify.
That she has been a willing, steady, silent,
humble toiler here for over two years, I know. I
feel as if it was unjust to her to remain in such a
lowly position; but I know not how she can be removed
from it.”</p>

<p>“I do,” said Mr. Legare.</p>

<p>“Ah! If not too bold, may I ask your plan?” said
Mr. W——, turning very red in the face.</p>

<p>“Simply this: I have a widowed sister-in-law. She
is a wealthy lady, of almost angelic disposition. She
is childless. I will get her to adopt this young lady.
She can give her a brilliant home, and a chance to
enjoy all her tastes and talents. I am sure, from
the character which you give of her, Miss Butler
will more than justify the adoption.”</p>

<p>“It would indeed be a generous and a noble act,
and could not be bestowed on a more worthy object,”
said Mr. W——.</p>

<p>And a sigh, which even he could hardly have accounted
for, followed his remark.</p>

<p>“She is staying at my house now, and I will have
her call at this girl’s boarding-house to see her,”
said Mr. Legare, “or perhaps it would be better she
should call here?”</p>

<p>“Would it not be easier for the lady to communicate
her offer by letter?” suggested Mr. W——.</p>

<p>“It might be easier, but hardly so satisfactory as
it would be for them to see each other, and judge, as
most people will from an interview, how one would<span class="pagenum">[76]</span>
like the other. But I’ll tell you what to do, W——,
sound the girl on the subject, and see what her feelings
are, and let me know. Then it will be time
enough to decide how to bring on a meeting between
her and Mrs. Emory, my sister-in-law.”</p>

<p>“All right, Mr. Legare. I will endeavor to disclose
your plan to Miss Butler in as delicate a manner as
possible. I know she is very high-strung and independent,
and she will shrink from incurring obligations
unless she feels that she can render an equivalent.”</p>

<p>“She could. My sister-in-law is a sad and lonely
woman. Some secret sorrow, which her friends
could never fathom, has laid heavily on her heart
for years. It makes her so melancholy at times that
we have almost feared for her reason. A sweet,
companionable girl, intellectual and gifted, would
be a blessing in her lonely home.”</p>

<p>“It would seem so. Can I speak of the lady and
her circumstances?” asked W——.</p>

<p>“Certainly. Say all that I have said to Miss Butler,
and add that I feel a fatherly interest in her
welfare. Were I childless, I would adopt her myself.
But I have two dear children, a son and
daughter, as you know, and they would think it
treason to them were I to invite another to my
home.”</p>

<p>“And who could blame them?” added Mr. W——.
“Well, I will approach the young lady on the matter,
and let you know what she thinks about it the
next time you call.”</p>

<p>“Which will be very soon,” said Mr. Legare, now
taking his leave.</p>

<p>“Jupiter Tonans! I see a way now which will
make even my proud sisters come to my views. The<span class="pagenum">[77]</span>
poor shop-girl, once adopted in a wealthy and aristocratic
family, will not be objectionable to them, if
indeed in that position she is ever recognized as
having been here. I will persuade her to accept this
adoption, and then, if it be possible to persuade her
to accept me as a husband, I shall be the happiest
man alive; for I cannot deny in my own heart that
I love the sweet girl even where she is, and as she
is, and had I only my own feelings to consult, I
would tell her so, and offer her my hand within the
hour.”</p>

<p>Thus soliloquized Mr. W——, while she who so
occupied his thoughts went steadily on with her
task, thinking, while so engaged, of nothing else.</p>

<p>And he was studying whether it would do to
approach her mind on this subject of adoption there
in the bindery, or at home in her boarding-house,
where possibly his interview, which might
be lengthy, would not be so noticed as it would be if
held in the shop or his office.</p>

<p>For he knew he could not be too careful, either for
her or for himself, in a world where nine-tenths of
the people are censorious and full of suspicion, and
the other tenth as ready to believe evil as good, no
matter whence it comes.</p>

<p>So he decided, having her address, as well as that
of every other employee, on his books, to call upon
her at her boarding-house.</p>

<p>So he sat down at his desk and wrote these words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Miss Hattie</span>:—Friends who feel a deep interest
in your welfare, who appreciate your clear intellect,
your excellent education, your talent, and your
graces of person and manner, have deputed me to
make a proposition alike honorable to you and nobly
generous in them—a proposition which will remove<span class="pagenum">[78]</span>
you from the world of toil and care to a position of
affluence and independence, without compromising
your dignity or lessening you in your esteem. To
convey the proposition, it is necessary I should hold
a brief interview with you, and it seems to me it
would be more consistent and proper for your position
and mine that I should hold the interview at
your residence or boarding-house. Therefore, I will
call there this evening, at eight o’clock, to see you,
in the presence of friends, if you think it necessary,
or alone, if you will trust in the sincerity and honor
of one who would wish to rank as your best and
most unselfish friend.</p>

<p class="ir2 pminus1">“<span class="smcap">Edward W</span>——.”</p>
</div>

<p>After reading this note carefully over, and finding
nothing to change in it, he sealed and directed it,
and going to Hattie’s table, just before it was time
to leave off work, laid the note before her, and
said:</p>

<p>“Do me a favor, Miss Hattie. This note is on important
business. But do not read it until you go
home.”</p>

<p>She bowed her head in assent.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">HATTIE’S RESOLVE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Hattie Butler left the bindery at her usual hour,
and pausing only long enough to buy an evening
paper, as she always did on her way, after her increase
of salary made her feel able to do so, she
hurried to her boarding-house.</p>

<p>Now, the writer is not one who believes that woman
is one half as full of curiosity as man is, but she
will not deny that her heroine really did feel decidedly
anxious to know the nature of the important
business which her employer had told her would be
revealed in the note which she was not to open until
she reached home.</p>

<p>Hattie lost no time in reaching home, and as she
had fully ten minutes to spare before the supper-bell
would ring, she went up to her room to take off her
bonnet and shawl, instead of leaving them on the
hooks in the long hall, as she generally did.</p>

<p>On her way to her room Hattie met Little Jessie
Albemarle, who ran to her and whispered:</p>

<p>“Miss Scrimp has been ever so good to me all day.
I’ve got a cot-bed, and sheets, and a pillow in my
room now, and I’m to have two new calico dresses
in a day or two.”</p>

<p>“I’m very glad, dear,” said Hattie. “I hope your
dark days are over, and that before long I shall have
very, very good news for you. Now, run down to
your work, dear—I’m going to my room a minute,
but will be down to supper.”</p>

<p>And Jessie, full of a new happiness—it was so
strange to be kindly treated even for a single day—ran<span class="pagenum">[80]</span>
down to her duties singing, while Hattie hurried
to her room, lighted her lamp, and opened her note.</p>

<p>A look of wonder and of real perplexity gathered
over and clouded her face as she read it a second
time.</p>

<p>“I cannot, for my life, understand his meaning.
What can the proposition be? He knows me too well
to ever make any offer but one that the noblest-born
woman in the world could accept. I am poor, but
I am proud—not of beauty, not of education, but of
a pure and spotless name, of an honor untarnished
by an evil act or thought. He speaks kindly, seems
to be very sincere, and is surely respectful. I will
meet him, and in the parlor below, for I would
blush to have any one see these poor surroundings,
when they know I could afford better. I know it is
against Miss Scrimp’s rules to admit gentleman
visitors to see her boarders, but in this case she
must permit the rule to be broken. I will tell her I
must see a gentleman on important business. He is
my employer, and it is my right to meet him here.”</p>

<p>This matter settled in her own mind, Hattie let
down her gloriously-beautiful hair, arranged her
simple toilet daintily, and went down stairs to supper
at the very moment the bell rang.</p>

<p>“Wonder on wonders! What will happen next!”
was what Wild Kate said as she filed with the rest
into the room.</p>

<p>There was an extra lamp over the center of the
long table, and the increased light shown on a row
of plates of cold tongue, sliced ham, cheese, and
three large, real sweet cakes, equally distant on
the table.</p>

<p>Such extravagance could not be remembered by
Miss Scrimp’s oldest boarder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[81]</span></p>

<p>And Little Jess was assisted by Biddy Lanigan
herself in passing around full cups—not of hot
water, but of real nice tea, with white sugar and
good milk.</p>

<p>“Miss Scrimp, you’re just the dearest old maid
that ever refused a good offer!” cried Wild Kate,
impulsively. “And you’re not old either. You are
twenty years younger to-night than you were last
night when I was saucing you, like the bad girl
that I am.”</p>

<p>“We’ll let bygones be bygones, Miss Kate. Take
hold—you’ll find no hairs in your butter to-night!”
said Miss Scrimp, quite graciously for her.</p>

<p>“If I did I wouldn’t be so mean as to tell of it!”
said Kate, as she took two slices of cold ham to herself.
“Girls, if this thing keeps on I’m one to put
down a dollar toward buying Miss Scrimp a new
silk dress!”</p>

<p>“And I will double it if we buy good nice dresses
for Biddy Lanigan and good Little Jessie!” said Hattie,
quietly, but distinctly from her chair near the
head of the table.</p>

<p>“Glory to her soul! I knew Miss Hattie wouldn’t
forget me!” cried Biddy, and she put a strong cup
of tea each side of her plate to show her gratitude.</p>

<p>The clatter of busy knives and forks, the cheerful
hum of happy voices now drowned everything else,
and Hattie, who made as usual but a light supper,
took occasion when she was sure no one else would
hear her to tell Miss Scrimp that Mr. W——, her
employer, had made an appointment to meet her
there on business at eight o’clock, and she wished to
see him in her parlor.</p>

<p>“You know it’s agin my rules, dear,” said Miss
Scrimp, trying hard to be gracious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[82]</span></p>

<p>“I know it, Miss Scrimp, and under no other circumstances
would I ask the favor,” replied Hattie,
still speaking in an undertone.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you see him in my room, and I’d make
it seem as if he came to see me on business,” said
Miss Scrimp, in a pleading tone. “You see, if once
I break over my rule, every girl in the house will be
askin’ to have her beau meet her in my parlor, and
the whole house would soon be overrun by horrid
men.”</p>

<p>“I did not take that view of the case when I made
the application. But, on second thought, I am very
willing to see Mr. W—— in your sitting-room and
in your presence.”</p>

<p>“That’s a dear, good girl! I’ll fix it so I let him
in myself, and I’ll take him right to my room,
where you’ll be, and not a girl in the house shall see
him, or know who he came to see other than me,”
said the old maid, happy at the thought that she
could hear what this important business was.</p>

<p>A secret to Miss Scrimp was a jewel to be
possessed at the risk of death almost.</p>

<p>Seeing that the clock at the end of the dining-room
was about to strike eight, she whispered to Hattie
to go to her room, and left the table herself just as
the front door bell rang.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum">[83]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE INTERVIEW.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“I’ll go to the door, dear—you keep on waitin’ on
the table. I’m expecting the house agent,” said
Miss Scrimp to Little Jessie, who started when she
heard the bell ring.</p>

<p>And while Miss Scrimp went to the front door,
Hattie Butler, in her usual leisurely way, left the
table, as if going to her own room. But, when out
of the dining-room, she hurried up the first flight of
stairs, and turned into the room used both as sitting-room
and chamber by Miss Scrimp. While at the
head of the stairs she heard her landlady say:</p>

<p>“Come right in, sir, you’re expected. Come right
in.”</p>

<p>The curiosity of Miss Scrimp to know what important
business her boarder could have, made the
old spinster even cordial to a horrid man.</p>

<p>In another minute Miss Scrimp shuffled in in her
slip-shod shoes, and she was followed by Mr. W——.</p>

<p>When the door was closed, Hattie formally introduced
the famous and wealthy proprietor of the
bindery to her boarding mistress, and then added:</p>

<p>“If you please, Mr. W——, you can mention your
business in the presence of this lady. I will answer
for her silence in regard to it hereafter, whatever
it may be.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, Miss Hattie,” said he.</p>

<p>But he was a little confused, and evidently would
not have had that vinegar-faced woman there if he
could help it. But in his own note he had told her<span class="pagenum">[84]</span>
to have witnesses to the interview if she desired,
and surely it was prudent to have that hideous old
ghost of a landlady there—perhaps policy, too, for
in contrast Hattie looked positively angelic.</p>

<p>Mr. W—— had never seen that wealth of glossy
raven hair floating in shining, curling masses down
over her white shoulders clear to her waist, before,
and she had put on a neat, real lace collar when she
went to her room; and a pair of daintily ruffled cuffs
made her small hands look even yet more delicate,
and they were such beautiful hands, without a
single ring to mar their delicate contour.</p>

<p>Mr. W—— hesitated only a moment, while his
eager eyes drank in that flood of beauty, and then
he said:</p>

<p>“I was sent to you by Mr. Legare, who has a
wealthy, widowed sister-in-law, a Mrs. Louisa
Emory, residing in a neighboring city, who is childless
and lonely. She is a lady in every sense, of a
sweet and loving disposition, and a companion like
yourself would be a treasure to her. If you will consent,
Mr. Legare, who, like myself, is truly and sincerely
your friend, and deeply interested in your
welfare, will propose to her that she adopt you as a
daughter—to receive all a daughter’s love and privileges.”</p>

<p>Hattie looked at Mr. W—— with astonishment.
The thought of being adopted as a daughter by a
lady of wealth whom she had never seen, and who
had never seen her, was so strange. And it was just
like the stupidity of mankind to go to work that
way about it.</p>

<p>“You can think of it leisurely, Miss Hattie, and
give me your answer in writing, if you like,” continued
Mr. W——.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[85]</span></p>

<p>“I will give you an answer before you leave, Mr.
W——,” said Hattie, quietly. “But before I do so
I would ask your opinion about this affair?”</p>

<p>“Really, Miss Hattie, I consider it one of the most
brilliant chances of your young life. You are too
well educated, too talented, and, believe me, I say it
not in flattery, too beautiful, to drudge your life
away in a book-bindery, when you can ornament
the highest circles of society. If you ask it as advice,
I would say accept this proposition, for it would
not have been made by Mr. Legare without he knew
it would prove a happiness to his often sad-hearted
sister-in-law. She is now visiting at his house, and
to-morrow an interview between you would soon
show how you would like her.”</p>

<p>“She might not like me,” said Hattie, with a
smile.</p>

<p>“How could she help it?” said Mr. W——, impulsively.</p>

<p>“There will be no need for her to try,” said Hattie,
gently but firmly. “Gratefully, but positively,
I must decline the tempting offer. I am content, Mr.
W——, to continue in my present condition in your
bindery. Miss Scrimp here makes it as pleasant as
possible for her boarders, and in receiving your
visit to-night has broken over one of her strictest
rules—never to permit the visits of gentlemen to
the house.”</p>

<p>“For which I thank her in sincerity,” said Mr.
W——, bowing gracefully to the old maid.</p>

<p>“Is your decision final? Must I take that answer
back to Mr. Legare?” he continued, addressing Hattie,
and not noticing the simpering smile with which
Miss Scrimp received his thanks.</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. W——. I am at least independent now,<span class="pagenum">[86]</span>
so long as health and strength last, and, thanks to
your generous increase of salary, I am laying up
money which will keep me so, even should sickness
reach me.”</p>

<p>“Heaven prevent that!” exclaimed Mr. W——.
“I can but admire your independence, and rejoice,
selfishly, that I am not to lose your valuable services
at the bindery. But I know Mr. Legare will
grieve at your decision. He said that if he had not
children of his own he would adopt you himself.”</p>

<p>“I am grateful for his interest, and yours also,
Mr. W——, while I decline the bright future you
would make for me. By the way, Mr. W——, let me
run up stairs to my room and get that portfolio of
drawings, or, rather, pencil sketches, which Mr.
Legare wished to see—that is, if it is not too much
trouble for you to take them.”</p>

<p>“It is not a trouble, but a pleasure instead,” he
said, and away she went.</p>

<p>“The dear creetur! Who’d think she’d refuse
such a chance? Most any girl in the world would
just snap at it,” said Miss Scrimp, determined to
keep the “horrid man” interested while in her presence.</p>

<p>“She is superior to most of her sex,” said Mr.
W——, with a sigh.</p>

<p>“That’s true as gospel,” said Miss Scrimp. And
she sighed, just to keep him company, you know.</p>

<p>Hattie was gone but a few seconds. Flushed in
color by her exercise—for she had run up and down
stairs—her beauty seemed heightened when she returned,
bearing a portfolio, with a clasp, and on it a
monogram—the letters “G. E. L.”</p>

<p>“They are all in here, and when he has looked
them over he can take any that he desires at his own<span class="pagenum">[87]</span>
price, and hand the rest back to you,” said Hattie,
as she handed the portfolio to Mr. W——.</p>

<p>“And I hope to be allowed to purchase what he
leaves, if indeed any,” said Mr. W——. “The
drawing you made in his book was a pleasant surprise
to me. I did not know we had such a talented
artist in the bindery.”</p>

<p>Mr. W—— arose to go, and Miss Scrimp stood
ready to see him to the door.</p>

<p>“Please wait here a minute, dear—I want to say
something to you,” she whispered to Hattie as she
went out.</p>

<p>After seeing Mr. W—— out, Miss Scrimp hurried
back and found Hattie waiting.</p>

<p>“What luck!” said the former, as she shuffled into
the room. “Not a girl in the house saw him come
or go. And what a nice man he is! Why, Miss
Hattie, I’d almost have him myself, if he’d ask me.
And I’d make no mean match, either. I’m just
forty-six, and I’ve a thousand dollars in bank for
every year of my life. Now, don’t tell him so—or if
you should happen to let it slip, be sure and tell
him not to tell any one else. I’ve got it safe in the
best bank in the city.”</p>

<p>“Was that all you wanted to say to me, Miss
Scrimp?” asked Hattie, not at all impressed by the
bank account of the ancient young lady of acknowledged
forty-six.</p>

<p>“Well, no; I wanted to say how I admired your
independence in refusing such a grand offer, and
that I’d keep your secret ever so close.”</p>

<p>“Miss Scrimp, it is no secret. I am utterly indifferent
whether it is known or remains unknown. It is
enough for me to keep your secrets.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[88]</span></p>

<p>And Hattie moved out of the room with the air of
a queen.</p>

<p>“Oh, the wretch! I could just scratch her eyes
out!” hissed Miss Scrimp, when the door closed and
she was alone. “I’m in her power, or I’d—I’d—the
mercy only knows what I wouldn’t do! I’ll bet that
bindery man’ll try to marry her. But he sha’n’t,
not if I can help it. I’ll marry him myself first.
I’ve got nigher sixty thousand dollars in bank, than
what I told her, and if he has got something to put
with it, he could give up book-binderies, and I’d let
out the boarding-house business to the first one
who’d take it. I don’t like horrid men, but I do
like him, he smiled so sweet when he thanked me
for breakin’ over my rules on his account.”</p>

<p>And the old spinster rubbed her thin, skinny
hands together, and stood up before her cracked
looking-glass, and made all sorts of pretty faces at
herself, while she smoothed down her false hair
and tried to see how interesting she could look in
the glass.</p>

<p>Satisfied, after wriggling into a dozen different
positions, she went down stairs to see if things were
cleared up at the table, and to take another cup of
tea in the kitchen, for she was a great tea-drinker.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">CRITICISING THE SKETCHES.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Mr. W—— went directly home after his interview
with Hattie Butler, and in the presence of his sisters,
Flotie and Anna, he opened the portfolio, and
together they examined the sketches—not less than
thirty or forty in number. They were on all kinds
of subjects—some landscapes and others figures.
Some few caricatures were exquisitely done—one
was the figure of a fashionable belle, looking
through an eye-glass at a poor ragged girl sweeping
a street crossing.</p>

<p>The two girls laughed over this till they cried—the
upturned nose of the belle fairly speaking her
scorn for the poor little sister of sorrow who was
trying to make the crossing passable for the lady’s
dainty feet.</p>

<p>“Why, Brother Edward, here you are!” cried
Flotie, as she took up a new sketch; “and you seem
to be scolding Mr. Jones, for it is his very picture,
standing as I saw him once, with a paste-pot in one
hand and a brush in the other.”</p>

<p>Mr. W—— looked at the sketch, and laughed as
heartily as his sisters had done.</p>

<p>“I remember that very scene,” he said. “I came
in one noon-time, when most of the hands were out,
and the rest at their noon lunches, and asked him
about some bank work—check-books, which were
to have been delivered that morning. He had mislaid
the order, the work was not done, and I was
very angry. I wonder if I did look as cross as she
has made out in the sketch? Mr. Legare will never<span class="pagenum">[90]</span>
see that sketch. I wouldn’t take a hundred dollars
in cash for it and give it up.”</p>

<p>“How she has hit you. It is charming; even to
the twist on the right mustache, which you always
finger when you are out of sorts,” said Anna.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is a perfect picture. I don’t believe Nast
could make my face out more correctly. What are
you looking at so intently, Flotie?”</p>

<p>“A sketch by a bolder hand, far different, and
marked ‘My Home.’ Heaven save me from ever
living in such a home.”</p>

<p>“Let me look at it.”</p>

<p>And Mr. W—— held a sketch beneath the gas-light,
which had creases in it, as if it had been
folded in a letter. It was drawn on poorer, thinner
paper than the rest also.</p>

<p>He saw a bold outline of mountains, ragged, cliffy,
and pine-covered, in the background. In front there
was a deep, rugged, shadowy ravine, through
which a foaming river rushed in fury. On a small,
level spot, almost backed up against a huge rock,
was a small log cabin, with smoke curling up from
the chimney of rough stones, which rose from the
ground at one end of the cabin.</p>

<p>In front of the open door of the cabin a young
man, bare-headed, was kneeling, his hands clasped,
and such a piteous, imploring look on the face that
it almost seemed to speak a prayer.</p>

<p>“There is a whole romance in that picture,” exclaimed
Mr. W——. “I do not believe Miss Butler
meant it should go with the rest to Mr. Legare. I
will keep it, at any rate, with this other sketch of
myself, till I know her wishes. The rest I will send
to Mr. Legare in the morning.”</p>

<p>“Oh, brother, who can this be? Such a nose, such<span class="pagenum">[91]</span>
a chin! Why, she is cross-eyed, too, and as thin as
a shadow, a very lean shadow at that,” cried Flotie,
over a new discovery.</p>

<p>“That is Miss Scrimp, the landlady where Miss
Butler boards,” said Mr. W——, laughing as heartily
as his sister did. “It is an excellent portrait. I presume
she is taken at the moment when she is laying
down the law to the poor creatures who are scrimped
at her board. It is a pity so much talent should have
been so long hidden over a sewing-bench in our
bindery.”</p>

<p>“And so much beauty, Edward. You don’t say a
word about that now.”</p>

<p>“What is the use, Anna. She is beautiful, but she
is poor, and only a book-bindery girl, after all. If
she had accepted the offer of adoption into a
wealthy lady’s family, as I hoped she would, you
could have met her as a lady, and loved her as a
woman.”</p>

<p>“As I’m afraid my brother does already,” said
Flotie, gravely. “It would never do, Edward, for
you to marry one of your own shop-girls, and hope
to introduce her to our circle.”</p>

<p>A sigh was his only response, and he arose from
the table and went to the window to hide his feelings.
For every hour, every moment, he thought of
that beautiful but poor girl—every instant when he
recalled her estimable pride and independence, the
modesty which had so long concealed talents which
left every female of his acquaintance far behind, he
loved her more and more.</p>

<p>“He has got it, and got it hard,” said Flotie to
Anna, looking at Edward as he stood there in
gloom, with his back toward them.</p>

<p>“Got what, Flotie?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[92]</span></p>

<p>“The disease called love, Anna. And he must be
cured in some way, or farewell to the opera, ball,
and theaters for us. What fools men are to fall in
love anyway. For my part, I don’t want one ever
to grow sickish over me.”</p>

<p>“What does this mean?” cried Anna. “The girl
who drew these sketches is named Hattie Butler, yet
the monogram on the portfolio is ‘G. E. L.’”</p>

<p>“Oh, most likely she is working under an assumed
name. Perhaps she has fallen in fortune, and did
not want to be known by any former acquaintance.
I don’t understand these things, and don’t want to.
There is no romance about a shop-girl, in my mind.”</p>

<p>Edward W—— heard this and sighed.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A TASK ACCOMPLISHED.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The next morning Mr. W—— sent one of his
house-servants to the residence of Mr. Legare with
the portfolio of drawings, but without any message,
for he knew the old gentleman would come to the
bindery to hear how he had fared in his mission,
and he could better tell him by word of mouth than
on paper.</p>

<p>But the two sketches—the caricature of himself
and foreman and the mountain scene—he took out,
and carried them with him when he went down to
the bindery. He went through the shop, as usual,
after his arrival, and saw all the hands at their various
benches and tables, and noticed with a sigh
that Hattie Butler, her hair neatly bound up, sat in
her plain, but becoming, dress at her table, apparently
unconscious of everything but the work before
her.</p>

<p>She did not even start and blush, as she had done
once before, when he spoke to her, as he now bade
her “good-morning,” but responded in a quiet, lady-like
way—cheerfully, too—“good-morning, Mr.
W——”</p>

<p>“Will you have the kindness to step into the office
by and by, Miss Hattie, when you are most at leisure?
I have something to show you,” he said.</p>

<p>“Certainly, Mr. W——. I have only ten more
pages to arrange in this volume, and it will take me
but a little while. Then I will come.”</p>

<p>Mr. W—— moved on around the room, speaking to
one employee here and there till he saw her start<span class="pagenum">[94]</span>
for the office, and he entered it a moment before she
did.</p>

<p>“I have taken a liberty, I fear,” said he, “but in
looking over your portfolio I found this sketch by a
different hand, and thinking you might not wish to
part with it to Mr. Legare, I took it from the portfolio
before sending it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you—thank you, Mr. W——. I would
not have parted with it for a world. I did not know
it was in there. I thought I had restored it to the
envelope in which it was sent to me by ——, a very
dear friend.”</p>

<p>She blushed, and seemed confused as she spoke
thus, rapidly, holding out her hand, and taking the
sketch.</p>

<p>“And on another point I have taken a liberty,”
he added, kindly looking away, that she might recover
from her agitation. “I found a very fine portrait
of myself and one of Mr. Jones, our foreman,
and, remembering well the scene, felt a desire to
preserve it. Will you allow me to purchase it?”</p>

<p>And he exhibited the sketch which had made him
and his sisters so merry the night before.</p>

<p>Hattie blushed to the very temples.</p>

<p>“Oh, forgive me, Mr. W——, I had forgotten that
I ever made that sketch. If I had only thought of
it I would have taken it out of the portfolio. But I
was in a hurry, and perhaps agitated in my mind,
when I got it and brought it down to you. Please
let me tear it up; it was a thoughtless sketch, taken
on the moment.”</p>

<p>“I would not have it torn up on any account,
Miss Hattie. It is perfect and truthful. I want to
frame it, and hang it up where I can see it every
day. It will teach me not to lose my temper, as I<span class="pagenum">[95]</span>
did that day, with an old and a faithful employee.
Please sell it to me.”</p>

<p>“I will not sell it to you, Mr. W——, but if you
attach any value to it, please keep it as a welcome
gift.”</p>

<p>“I thank you, Miss Hattie—from my heart I thank
you. I will strive to make you a suitable return in
some way.”</p>

<p>“I need none, Mr. W——. Is this all you require
of me?”</p>

<p>“All at present, Miss Hattie. There is something
I would like to talk with you about, but I will put it
off to a time when I can speak and you listen
thoughtfully.”</p>

<p>Hattie bowed, and went out to her work, after
folding up that mountain sketch.</p>

<p>“I wonder who that very dear friend can be who
sent her that sketch,” muttered Mr. W——, after
Hattie had gone. “How she blushed when she spoke
of whence it came, and took it from my hand. Oh,
I hope and pray her heart is not already gone. If it
is, what have I to hope for? For I love her—madly
love her. I must know if her heart is disengaged.
I dare not trust myself to ask her; I should break
down in the attempt. I’ll write to her. Yes, on paper
I may be able to express my thoughts.”</p>

<p>And going out to Mr. Jones, he gave directions
that he was not to be disturbed by any one, except
on the most unavoidable business, for the next hour.</p>

<p>And then he sat down at his desk to try to write
out his hopes and his wishes, not asking now, as he
had once before, “What will the world say about
it?”</p>

<p>It seemed a hard task, for three times he filled a<span class="pagenum">[96]</span>
sheet of paper and then burned it. It seemed as if
he couldn’t get his thoughts together to suit him.</p>

<p>But at last he completed his letter, sealed and directed
it, and made up his mind to hand it to Hattie
just as she was leaving work at night.</p>

<p>And his heart was lighter after the work was
done. He had allowed himself to rise above the
cold conventionalities of a callous, heartless world—to
say to himself, “If she will but have me, I will
wed worth, modesty, purity, beauty, and virtue, no
matter how humble the source from whence all
these attributes spring. I will not allow false pride
or the opinions of others to chill the ardor of true
and manly affection. I will be true to nature and
nature’s God, and respond to the warm and noblest
impulses which He alone can plant in the human
breast.”</p>

<p>And it seemed as if a brighter light beamed in his
eye when he left his office and came out among his
work-people. There was surely a kindlier tone in
his voice.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">GOOD ADVICE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The library of Mr. Legare was a favorite resort
for his sister-in-law, Mrs. Louisa Emory—or Aunt
Louisa, as Frank and Lizzie delighted to call her.
In his books, and also in the paintings, she found
joys which none but an intellectual woman could
find, and here, even in her most melancholy moods,
she would brighten up.</p>

<p>Frank and Lizzie, who thought there was no one
on earth like their aunt, were with her when Mr. Legare
came into the library with the portfolio just received
from Mr. W——.</p>

<p>“Come, sister, come, children, and look at my
new treasures with me,” cried the old gentleman,
taking a seat at his private writing and reading-table,
and opening the portfolio.</p>

<p>“What are these?” asked Mrs. Emory, as he
spread out the drawings all over the table.</p>

<p>“Sketches from the pencil of that wonderful girl
in the book-bindery—the one I have already talked
to you about. Look at this caricature—a fashionable
belle and a poor street-sweeper. Is it not almost
a speaking sketch? See the abject, almost
hopeless look in the face of the poor girl. Who
would believe a pencil, without color, could give so
much expression?”</p>

<p>“Your protege has wonderful talent,” said Mrs.
Emory, her interest awakened. “Here is a portrait—merely
a face—that of a young girl? Is it that of
the artist herself?”</p>

<p>“No, it is not at all like her,” said the old gentleman,<span class="pagenum">[98]</span>
looking at it closely. “This is a picture of a
young girl, pretty, but thin and weary-looking.
Hattie Butler is not only very handsome, but very
lady-like. Louisa, you would be proud of her if she
were your daughter.”</p>

<p>A look of agony passed over the face of the lady;
she turned deathly pale, and for an instant she
looked as if she would faint.</p>

<p>A cry of alarm broke from the young people, and
Mr. Legare cried out:</p>

<p>“Are you ill, dear sister, are you ill?”</p>

<p>“A spasm. It will soon pass away,” she said,
and with a sad smile she tried to still the alarm of
her anxious relatives.</p>

<p>“I should like to see this gifted young woman,”
she said, after regaining her composure. “Do you
think you could induce her to call upon me here? I
do not want to go to that bindery; and if she is as
proud and independent as you say, it might wound
her feelings to have me go unannounced, and without
an introduction, to her boarding-house.”</p>

<p>“I will see her when I make a selection of these
drawings for purchase, and try and induce her to
visit you,” said Mr. Legare.</p>

<p>“Take them all, dear father. They are really
very, very fine,” cried Frank, who had been looking
them over with unwonted attention for him.
“Here is a gem—it is sarcastic, but so true. A foppishly-dressed
fellow is leaving his seat in the car,
and handing a well-dressed lady into it, while a
poor old woman on crutches stands close by. She
has eyes, that girl has, and knows how to use them.
If I were in your place, father, and had influence
with her, I should get her to make art her profession.<span class="pagenum">[99]</span>
One who draws so well would soon take to
color, even if she has not already tried it.”</p>

<p>“I’ll warrant she paints,” said Lizzie, rather
satirically, looking at her brother to see if he would
feel the shaft.</p>

<p>“Not in the sense you mean,” he said, indignantly.
“It takes the daughters of rich fathers to
use cosmetics and other necessary articles to enhance
their beauty. The poor toiler gets her color
from exercise and honorable labor.”</p>

<p>“Well met, my little lady. Frank rather had you
there,” said Mr. Legare, laughing.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, papa, you’ll side with him, because you
think so much of her. You’d better change me off
for her,” cried Lizzie, angrily, and then she fell to
weeping.</p>

<p>As I heard a Western man say, “that was her best
hold;” she always conquered with it.</p>

<p>“Dear child, do not be so silly. No one wishes to
supplant you. And I am sure your brother had no
wish to wound your feelings,” said Mr. Legare, tenderly.</p>

<p>“No, indeed, sis, not a thought of it. If it will
make you feel any easier in your mind, I’ll vow
that I believe this low-born beauty paints and powders,
too.”</p>

<p>“How do we know she is low-born?” asked Mrs.
Emory, gravely, but kindly. “Her education and
gifts—her very genius would speak to the contrary.
Many a well-born person, by a sudden change of
fortune, has been reduced to labor. And I, for one,
do not consider labor dishonorable. It is hard to be
forced to toil for one’s daily bread, if one has to
come to it from affluence, but it is not evil. It must<span class="pagenum">[100]</span>
be very inconvenient to be poor; but surely in a
grand republic like this it is not a disgrace.”</p>

<p>“Huzza for Aunt Louisa! That’s my philosophy,
too,” cried Frank.</p>

<p>Lizzie laughed. She couldn’t cry over three minutes
at a time, and then smiles followed, just as the
sunlight comes after an April shower.</p>

<p>“Your Aunt Louisa always takes a sensible view
of things, my dear children, and though she makes
no boasts of it, I dare say few persons more often
extend the full hand of Christian charity.”</p>

<p>“That’s the hand to play,” cried Frank, thinking
of his last rubber of whist at the club-room.</p>

<p>“The hand which helps us forward on the road to
Heaven,” said his father, in a grave tone. “And I
wish my dear children to feel that while they are
living in luxury, knowing no sorrow or grief but
what in imagination they make for themselves,
heavy hearts and fainting spirits are all around
them. That kind words, followed by kindly deeds,
will brighten their way as they go onward and
upward in life, even as I feel that such things are
softening my descent toward the grave.”</p>

<p>Both son and daughter drew near their good old
father and kissed him reverently. His words had
fallen on their hearts at the right moment.</p>

<p>“Forgive me, papa, because I spoke slightingly
of the poor girl in whom you have justly taken such
an interest. If she comes here to Aunt Louisa, I
will treat her just as well as I would my dearest
school-mate or best friend.”</p>

<p>“There spoke my own blessed girl,” said Mr.
Legare, proudly. “Your heart is in the right place,
little one, though we have petted you so much that
you forget it sometimes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[101]</span></p>

<p>“Sis, you’re a trump—that’s what you are. And I
love you—just bet all you have I do.”</p>

<p>“Frank, I know you love me—but there is that
lunch-bell again. Come, Aunt Louisa, I ordered
oyster patties, because I know you like them so.”</p>

<p>“And we’ve a brace of partridges, father, that Egbert
Tripp sent down from Ulster County to me, and
I told the cook to lard them with bacon and broil
them brown for you,” added Frank.</p>

<p>“They’re good children, Louisa—a little spoiled,
but at heart real good children,” said the proud father,
as he offered his sister-in-law his arm.</p>

<p>“It is true, brother, and I love my niece and
nephew dearly,” said Mrs. Emory. “They make my
visits here very pleasant. It would be a dreary
world to me were it not for you and them.”</p>

<p>“Forward two!” cried Frank, as he clasped Lizzie
around the waist and waltzed into the lunch-room.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">JESSIE ALBEMARLE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Miss Hattie,” said Mr. W——, just as the people
were leaving work, and she was rising from her
table, “please put this letter in your pocket, read it
after you have had your supper, and think over its
contents. Do not hurry your thoughts—I will wait
patiently for an answer after you have well considered
what I have written. Let days pass, if you
choose, I will not urge a reply; I only ask it after
you have given the matter thought.”</p>

<p>She looked up at him with her earnest, truthful
eyes, for she noticed that his voice trembled, and
almost intuitively she felt that that letter contained
a declaration of what his eyes seemed to speak when
they met her look—love.</p>

<p>She put the letter in her pocket without a word.
She could not have spoken at that moment. For,
noticing his agitation, a strange tremor came over
her.</p>

<p>He turned, blushing, and went toward his office,
while she, putting on her hat and shawl, turned
toward the door. At that moment she saw the
stately form of Mr. Legare in front of Mr. W——, and
the foreman had scarcely spoken to him when Mr.
W—— called to her.</p>

<p>The millionaire had come in person to see the poor
working girl—to hear her decision, and to ask of
her a favor.</p>

<p>“Miss Butler, excuse me that I called at this hour.
I knew you would be disengaged, and perhaps
could do me a great favor if it is not already done<span class="pagenum">[103]</span>
by your consenting to the adoption which I had the
honor to propose through Mr. W——.”</p>

<p>“Gratefully, Mr. Legare, I have declined that
proposition in an interview held with Mr. W—— at
my boarding-house last evening.”</p>

<p>“Yet, my good young friend, you have never met
the lady who would take you to her home and
heart. She is one of the purest, noblest women on
earth. The sister of my dear, dead wife. I have
known her these long, long years, and I never met
her equal. Her heart is full of sweet sympathies,
pure charities, and ennobling thoughts.”</p>

<p>“I do not doubt her goodness, sir. Her offer,
through you, proves it. The poor working girl
thanks her from the bottom of her heart. But this
adoption cannot be. Alone I have toiled on for almost
three long, to me, very long years. Alone I
must continue to tread life’s pathway. I am contented.
Why, then, ask me to change? There are
thousands upon thousands just as worthy as I, and
more needy, upon whom such a noble boon can be
conferred. Let your good sister-in-law look for
such a one.”</p>

<p>Hattie Butler spoke so earnestly that the two gentlemen
deeply felt her appeal. They knew that she
alone had the right to choose. But Mr. Legare did
not yet despair of carrying his point. He had yet
another angle of attack.</p>

<p>“I have received your portfolio of drawings, am
delighted with them, and shall take them at your
own price,” he continued.</p>

<p>“I set no value on them. They surely are worth
but little more than the paper they are drawn on.
They are the result of lazy moments, not spent at
work or in study.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[104]</span></p>

<p>“To me they are worth one thousand dollars in
gold, and my check is ready for your acceptance,
if the price will suit you.”</p>

<p>“One thousand dollars?” gasped Hattie, utterly
taken by surprise. “One thousand dollars in gold?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Miss Butler. I am serious. I want the
drawings—all are good, and some of them are gems.
The street-car scene especially, and the little
sweeper on the crossing. My son and daughter
went into ecstasies over them. By the way, my
daughter is in my carriage now, down on the street,
and wishes to see you. She and I have a great favor
to ask of you, and Mr. W—— is included in it.”</p>

<p>“Please tell me what it is, sir. The supper hour
once over in my boarding-house, and I miss the
meal altogether, and it will be supper time now before
I can reach there.”</p>

<p>“You will not miss your supper if you do me the
favor I ask. It is this: That, even as you are, in
your neat working-dress, of which no lady need be
ashamed, you ride home with me and my daughter,
see my sister-in-law, take a plain family tea with
us, Mr. W—— included, and then let me drive you
home to your boarding-house. Don’t say no before I
finish. My dear sister-in-law, almost an invalid, has
expressed a strangely nervous desire to see you, if
only for a few moments, before she sleeps. You will
perhaps save her from a fit of sickness if you go.
My daughter came with me to plead for her poor
aunt.”</p>

<p>Hattie paused a moment to think. Not of her
dress, but whether it would be right to refuse under
such circumstances. Not of the thousand dollar
check waiting for her, but whether it would be<span class="pagenum">[105]</span>
proper for a poor, friendless working girl to thus accept
the hospitality of the rich.</p>

<p>She did not hesitate long. The picture of that
poor nervous lady waiting and anxious just to see
her arose in her mind, and she said:</p>

<p>“I will go, Mr. Legare, on two conditions. First,
that you will drive past my boarding-house, so that
I can leave word where I am going; next, that you
will permit me to make my stay very brief at your
house. Miss Scrimp, where I board, locks her doors
at ten o’clock. I have boarded with her over two
years, and have never been out of the house before
after dark.”</p>

<p>“The conditions are agreed to. Mr. W—— shall
see you safely home in my carriage by nine o’clock
or half-past at latest. Now, come down and see my
daughter, Lizzie, who waits to greet you.”</p>

<p>Hattie followed Mr. Legare, and Mr. W——, full
of surprise, followed both. He had never reached
the entree of that wealth-adorned house, though he
had met young Legare at his club.</p>

<p>At the carriage Mr. Legare called “Lizzie,” and
the sweet face of the young girl beamed out like
that of a cherub, when, on Hattie being presented,
she said:</p>

<p>“Jump right in here on the seat by my side, dear
Miss Butler. Papa has talked so much about you
that it seems as if I had known you ever so long.”</p>

<p>And when Hattie stepped in the little girl threw
her arms around her with all the fervor of sweet
sixteen, and kissed her.</p>

<p>Hattie could but respond to such a welcome, and
she returned the salute.</p>

<p>Mr. Legare seated Mr. W—— on the front seat,
and then sat beside him, and when the number of<span class="pagenum">[106]</span>
Miss Scrimp’s house was given, the driver started
for it at a sweeping trot.</p>

<p>“Aunt Louisa will be so glad to see you, you good,
dear beauty!” said Lizzie, clasping Hattie’s hand in
hers. “We have been looking your drawings over
and over, and there is one face there on which she
dwells all the time. She says it fairly haunts her,
and she wants to know if it is a portrait.”</p>

<p>“I cannot tell till I see it myself!” said Hattie.</p>

<p>The next moment the carriage had come to a halt.
In less than five minutes it had passed over the
space which Hattie could not walk inside of twenty
minutes. And she ever went quickly on, heeding
nothing on her route.</p>

<p>“I will go to the door myself, and explain to Miss
Scrimp,” said Hattie. “It will not take me a half
minute.”</p>

<p>The footman opened the carriage door. Mr. Legare
himself handed Hattie out, and she ran to the
door, and rung a startling peal on the old bell.</p>

<p>Miss Scrimp, unused to such a peal, came herself
to the door instead of sending Little Jessie, and to
her Hattie only said:</p>

<p>“I am going up town on a special errand with Mr.
Legare and his daughter. I will need no supper
when I come back, which will be before ten
o’clock!”</p>

<p>Before the astonished Miss Scrimp could ask a
single question her fair boarder darted away, entered
the gorgeous carriage, where the old spinster
saw a richly-dressed young lady and two gentlemen,
the footman closed the door and sprang to his
place, and the noble horses dashed forward, and in
a second more were out of sight.</p>

<p>All the old maid said then was:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[107]</span></p>

<p>“Sakes alive!”</p>

<p>And this she said as she went in and slammed the
door.</p>

<p>In the meantime the carriage swept on up through
the wide streets of the upper part of the city—streets
so different from the narrow, busy thoroughfares
below, or down town—and in a little more
than half an hour, passed in cheery talk, mostly
kept up by Lizzie Legare, it drew up before a marble
mansion on the finest avenue in the great city.</p>

<p>“Here we are at home!” cried Mr. Legare, as the
carriage door flew open, “and there is my dear son,
Frank, to welcome us. Frank, my boy, this is Miss
Butler. Mr. W—— you already know.”</p>

<p>Frank bowed most respectfully to Hattie, as he
extended his hand to help her from the carriage,
and he cast a mischievous glance at Lizzie, as the
latter sprang out, and taking Hattie’s arm as if she
were a dear old friend, drew her up the steps, saying:</p>

<p>“We’ll run to my room, dear, to take off our
things and dash some water in our faces before
tea.”</p>

<p>And when Hattie came down to tea with Lizzie,
just ten minutes later, her beautiful hair was all
down over her shoulders, and a real lace collarette
was around her neck, and she looked, even in her
plain calico dress, as beautiful as beautiful could
be; and Lizzie had kissed her twenty times when
she was helping her to make her brief toilet.</p>

<p>At the tea-table Hattie was introduced to Mrs.
Emory, whose long, yearning look fairly entered
her soul. It seemed as if in Hattie she sought to
find some favorite resemblance, so eagerly did she
scan her face and form. She said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[108]</span></p>

<p>“I have heard so much of you, and seen such talent
exhibited in your drawings, Miss Butler, that I
felt as if I could not sleep till I had seen you. Do
not think me impertinent or intrusive. You look
so good, so pure, so gentle, I know you will forgive
me.”</p>

<p>“I am sure there is nothing to forgive. I was only
too happy to come when they told me you were partially
an invalid, and I could do you good by coming.”</p>

<p>“Bless you, dear child! bless you for it! After
tea we will look at your drawings; there is one especially
I wish to know all about.”</p>

<p>Nothing more of any special interest was said
until tea was over, and then they all adjourned to
the library to look over the drawings.</p>

<p>“Whose picture is this?—or is it a fancy sketch
instead of a portrait?” asked Mrs. Emory of Hattie,
laying her finger on the head of a young girl that
was spoken of before in this story.</p>

<p>“That? Why, it is the portrait of Little Jessie
Albemarle,” said Hattie.</p>

<p>A deathly pallor came quicker than thought over
Mrs. Emory’s face. She gasped out, “Jessie Albemarle!”
and fainted.</p>

</div>


<p>A scream of terror broke from Lizzie’s lips when
she saw her aunt fall back fainting, but she did not
know the cause. Neither did Frank or Mr. Legare.
Not even had Mr. W——, who sat talking with
Frank, heard her repeat the name: “Jessie Albemarle.”</p>

<p>Only Hattie Butler had heard it, and seen that
her agitation commenced only when told who the
likeness had been taken from, and though a lightning
flash could not have passed quicker than a certain
thought crossed her mind, she dare not utter it
then or there.</p>

<p>“Quick, some water!” she cried, retaining her
presence of mind perfectly, as she held the head of
the swooning lady on her bosom, “and some cologne—hartshorn—anything
pungent. She has fainted!”</p>

<p>“Frank, run for our family doctor, quick! He lives
but a block away. Go yourself—don’t send a servant!”
cried Mr. Legare, and he hurried to get iced
water from a pitcher in the room, while Lizzie ran
to her room after cologne and ammonia.</p>

<p>But the swoon seemed so death-like that Hattie
was alarmed. She began to fear that it was death.
She forced a little water between the white lips, and
bathed the good lady’s temples with cologne, while
by her directions Lizzie put ammonia on her handkerchief
and held it under her nostrils.</p>

<p>When the doctor arrived, in less than ten minutes,
these active efforts had barely produced a tremulous
sign of life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[110]</span></p>

<p>“Let her be conveyed instantly to bed!” was the
doctor’s first order. “It is one of her old nervous
spasms, and they grow dangerous. She must remain
perfectly quiet, free from all excitement, when
she is restored to consciousness. She will soon come
to. The color is coming back to her cheeks.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Emory was carried to a chamber on the same
floor, and Lizzie and Hattie prepared her for rest,
not allowing a servant to come near, and then Hattie,
fearing she would be questioned by the invalid,
before others, when it might not really be the wish
of Mrs. Emory, expressed a wish to go home, saying
she would come again should Mrs. Emory desire it.
She would not reach her boarding-house, as it was,
much before ten o’clock.</p>

<p>“You’ll come to see me again, will you not, dear?
For I do love you so!” said Lizzie, when Mr. Legare
ordered his carriage to the door to take Hattie to
her boarding-house.</p>

<p>“Yes—I hope so. I wish I had a fit place to receive
your visits in, but I fear you would be ashamed
of me in my little bedroom.”</p>

<p>“No, no, now that I know you, I wouldn’t be
ashamed of you anywhere. I’ll go to the bindery to
see you, if Mr. W—— will permit visitors there.”</p>

<p>And Lizzie looked appealingly at him.</p>

<p>“I surely shall ever be glad to see you at the bindery,
and Miss Hattie will not be chided for any time
she spends with you, either here or there, nor will
her salary be lessened.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you good soul! Frank always said you were
one of nature’s noblemen,” cried the impulsive girl.</p>

<p>“I thank Frank for his good words,” said Mr.
W——, laughing, yet blushing at the same time.</p>

<p>The doctor came down just before Hattie started,<span class="pagenum">[111]</span>
and said Mrs. Emory was better, but very weak.
She begged that Miss Butler would come and see
her on the afternoon of to-morrow, when she hoped
she would be well; at least able to sit up and receive
her. She was much afflicted with the palpitation
of the heart, and this now followed her fainting
spell.</p>

<p>Hattie, told by Mr. W—— that she could have all
the time she wished, sent word to Mrs. Emory that
she would come, and now, escorted by Frank, Lizzie
and their father, she went down to the carriage.
Mr. W—— accompanied, for he was to see her safely
to her boarding-house, and then ride home in the
carriage.</p>

<p>A kind good-night from all of the Legares went
with the poor working girl, and it seemed as if they
really regarded her visit as a favor, though through
the sudden illness of Mrs. Emory it had turned out
sadly.</p>

<p>Mr. W—— was silent and thoughtful during the
brief time taken by the swift horses to draw the carriage
to Miss Scrimp’s door. Without a doubt his
mind was upon the letter then in Hattie’s pocket,
and what might be her answer.</p>

<p>She was thinking of Mrs. Emory, and what had
caused her sudden pallor and terrible agitation, resulting
in a swoon at the mere mention of the name
of poor little Jessie Albemarle. Could it be that a
brighter future was about to dawn for the poor little
bound girl?</p>

<p>Ten strokes of the great clock bell on St. Paul’s,
echoed all over the city by other clocks, told Hattie
Butler that the hour for closing was up, just as the
carriage stopped in front of Miss Scrimp’s door.</p>

<p>Hattie did not know that Miss Scrimp had been<span class="pagenum">[112]</span>
waiting and watching at that door for almost an
hour, peeping through the crack, for it was not
quite closed, to see how and with whom she would
return. But this was a fact. And when the street
lamp close by shone on the grand carriage and
noble horses, with their gold-mounted harness, Miss
Scrimp saw, with envy rankling in her heart, the
tall footman leap down and open the carriage door,
and Mr. W——, even him on whom she had bent
longing thoughts, hand Hattie Butler out with his
gloved hands, as daintily as if she were a princess
and he a lord in waiting.</p>

<p>There was a courteous “good-night” passed between
Hattie and her escort, then he sprang into
the carriage, and it was driven off, while Hattie ran
lightly up the old stone steps in front of the house
and laid her hand on the bell-pull.</p>

<p>“Oh, you needn’t yank at that bell!” cried Miss
Scrimp, throwing the door open. “It’s after hours,
but I was up, and a-waitin’ for you!”</p>

<p>“You did not have to wait long, Miss Scrimp. Not
half the city clocks are yet done striking ten. I may
be thirty seconds late by the City Hall!”</p>

<p>“Long enough, in a chilly night like this. Where
have you been?”</p>

<p>“You have no right to ask, Miss Scrimp. But having
nothing to conceal, I will reply—to Mr. Legare’s,
on Fifth-avenue.”</p>

<p>“Sakes alive. What did them grand folks want
of you?”</p>

<p>“To take tea with them, and to purchase a few
drawings of mine for a thousand dollars!” said Hattie,
well knowing this last stroke would almost annihilate
Miss Scrimp.</p>

<p>“Sakes alive! you’re joking!” screamed Miss<span class="pagenum">[113]</span>
Scrimp, snatching up the hand-lamp she had left on
the hall table.</p>

<p>“Does that look like a joke?” asked Hattie, and
she placed the thousand-dollar check which Mr. Legare
had handed to her after tea, right under Miss
Scrimp’s cross-eyes.</p>

<p>“Mercy on me! You’ll never go the bindery no
more, will you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I shall go there to my work in the morning,
just as I always do,” said Hattie, and she was off up
stairs before Miss Scrimp could ask another question.</p>

<p>“Well, well! Wonders will never stop a-comin’!”
ejaculated Miss Scrimp. “If I hadn’t seen her go in
the carriage and come in the carriage, and seen Mr.
W—— help her out, I wouldn’t have believed my
eyes. One thousand dollars—in a real check, too—I
knew it soon as I saw it. Aren’t I dreamin’?”</p>

<p>She actually bit her finger to see if she was awake
or not.</p>

<p>Then she sighed.</p>

<p>“It’s luck. Some people are always havin’ luck,”
she said. “Here have I been a-makin’ and a-savin’,
a-scrimpin’ and a-studyin’ all the time for forty years
or more, and I haven’t had a bit o’ luck. It’s all
been hard, stupid work. And that baby-faced thing
will jump right into a fortune, I’ll bet, and like as
not marry that handsome book-bindery man right
before my face and eyes. Sakes alive! it chokes me
to think of it. If I wasn’t afraid of what might happen
I’d spoil her beauty for her. I’d put arsenic
into her tea, or pison her some way. She a-ridin’
around with my man, that ought to be, in a carriage,
while I stand here a-shiverin’ like a thief in a
corner a-waitin’ for her. But I mustn’t make her<span class="pagenum">[114]</span>
mad. She has got a thousand dollars, and I’ll raise
on her board, and make her come down, too. She
can afford it, and she shall.”</p>

<p>Miss Scrimp said this vehemently, and then shuffled
up stairs to her own room.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE OFFER REFUSED.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>All was still in the house when Hattie climbed up
those long and dreary stairs, for tired working girls
go to sleep early and sleep soundly.</p>

<p>They know the day must not dawn on their closed
eyes, but they must be up, wash, eat, and off to labor
before the sun from its eastern up-lift gilds the
city spires.</p>

<p>Hattie entered her room, set her lamp alight,
took off her things, and sat down by her bedside to
think.</p>

<p>She took the letter from her pocket which Mr.
W—— had given her at the bindery, and put it
down on the table, unopened, and there it lay for
full a quarter of an hour, while she was lost in her
meditation.</p>

<p>And yet men say a woman is made up of curiosity.
And that is all men know about it. They
can say so, but it doesn’t make it so.</p>

<p>At last she took up the letter, looked again at her
name written in a bold, handsome hand on a business
envelope of the firm, and then she broke the
seal.</p>

<p>The color came and went in her face, showing surprise,
agitation, and even pain, while she read it.
That we may understand her feelings it may be as
well to give the letter place here. It ran thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Miss Hattie</span>:—I feel embarrassed, hardly knowing
how to frame words to express a desire, a hope,
and a fear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[116]</span></p>

<p>“The desire is, in all sincerity, honor, truth, and
tenderness, to possess you as my wife—the holiest
relationship known on earth.</p>

<p>“The hope is that you will listen to and reciprocate
a love which I believe to be pure and unselfish—a
love based on your merits rather than your transcendent
beauty—a love, which, though fervent, will
be, I am sure, lasting as my life.</p>

<p>“A fear that I am not worthy of the boon I ask—your
love and hand—or, alas for me if it prove so,
that young as you are, some one else has already
gained the heart which I would give worlds, were
they mine, to claim as my own, all my own.</p>

<p>“Can you respond favorably to this petition? I
ask no speedy answer. I will press no unwelcome
suit. Come and go as you always do, bringing
brightness when I see you, leaving a void in my
eyes, but not in my heart, as you pass out, and when
you feel that you can answer me do so, confident
that I shall ever love you. I shall never presume to
press one word on your ear which shall bring a
frown on the face so dear to me. God bless you,
Miss Hattie, and may He turn your heart to thoughts
of your sincere friend,</p>

<p class="ir2 pminus1">“E. W——.”</p>
</div>

<p>For a love-letter, it was a model. I say so, and I
ought to know, for, young as I am, I’ve got a waste-basket
half full of them.</p>

<p>Tears started in Hattie’s eyes as she carefully refolded
the letter and restored it to the envelope.</p>

<p>“He is a true and a noble man,” she said. “A
gentleman in every sense. But I cannot return his
love. How can I say so and not wound his generous
and sensitive nature? I must think of it—I must ask
advice and aid from that unfailing source which
never will bid me do wrong.”</p>

<p>And the pure, sweet girl knelt by her humble bed
in silent prayer. Then she arose, her heart lighter,
her eyes bright with new inspiration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[117]</span></p>

<p>She drew up to her table, opened a small portable
writing-desk, and rapidly wrote these words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Mr. W——</span>:—<em>Esteemed and Valued Friend</em>. The
desire you express can never be gratified, because,
while feeling your worth, knowing how good and
truthful you are, I know in heart I cannot harbor
the love which would be a just return for that which
you feel and offer. It will make me very unhappy
to think I sadden your bright life in any way. Try
to forget love in the friendship I shall ever feel so
proud and happy to possess.</p>

<p>“With sympathy and sincerity, I am your humble
friend,</p>

<p class="ir2 pminus1">“<span class="smcap">Hattie Butler</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>She bowed her head and wept after she had sealed
and directed her letter, for she felt sorrow in her
soul that her answer must pain so warm a heart.</p>

<p>Then she knelt again in silent prayer, read, as she
ever did, a chapter in the revealed word of God, and
then lay down to the rest which innocence alone can
enjoy—that quiet, dreamless rest which gives new
life to the body and the soul.</p>

<p>And thus we will leave her, while for a time and
for a reason we fly far away on the swift wings of
fancy to a different—a far different scene.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">SCENE IN THE YOSEMITE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Not in all California—not even in the grandly
glorious valley among the cliffs and gorges of the
famed Yosemite, can be found a wilder scene than
that exhibited where the Feather River breaks in
furious haste through an awful chasm in the Sierra
Nevada. A friend, a dear friend, who mined there
for years, has described it over and over, and talked
to me about it till I can hear the eternal roar of the
white waters, feel the very cliffs shake with the dizzy
dash and whirl of its cataracts—look down on the
eddies where gold, washed from the veins above
which may never be reached by mortal hand, has
been accumulating for centuries.</p>

<p>While our fair heroine was sleeping, taking the
rest which nature needed, in a small log cabin on a
little shelf of rock and ground just above where the
Feather River broke in wild grandeur through the
gorge, before a fire made from the limbs of trees
cast on shore by the torrent in a whirling eddy just
below, a young man sat, with a weary look on his
fine, intellectual face, looking into the fire.</p>

<p>Mining tools—a pick, shovels, crowbars, and hose—crucibles
also, empty and full flasks of quicksilver,
with many other signs, told that this man, young
and slender, and not well fitted for toil, was a
searcher for the gold with which those eternal hills,
that rushing stream, are liberally stocked.</p>

<p>Fishing-rods and tackle, a double-barreled shotgun,
and a repeating-rifle stood in one corner of the
cabin, showing that in the water and among the<span class="pagenum">[119]</span>
hills the young man was prepared to find the food
which is so plentiful there, and was not dependent
on the far-away stores of Oroville, Marysville, or
Sacramento, from which many of the miners drew
supplies.</p>

<p>Though this man was young—not over five-and-twenty
years of age—there was a weary look in his
pale, handsome face, which made him look older.
Light-brown hair curled in heavy masses on his
shapely head and fell far down on his shoulders, and
his beard, a soft, silken brown, not heavy, but long,
told that no tonsorial hand had touched it for many
months.</p>

<p>“It will be three years to-morrow,” he said.
“Three years to-morrow since I looked upon her in
her glorious pride and beauty—three years to-morrow
since the hour when, madly disgraced by my
own folly and the wild passion for strong drink,
which has ruined millions of better men than I, I
stood before her to hear my sentence, to be told to
go from her presence and never to return till she recalled
me, which she would only do when she knew
I had forever conquered an appetite that had debased
my manhood and froze all the love she had
given me—a love, oh, so precious, so priceless, so
pure!</p>

<p>“Wild with rage and disappointment, I tore myself
away and fled with the adventurous throng to
this El Dorado, but I dared not stay where men were
and strong drink abounded. I wandered on and on
until I could go no farther, and here, the highest
claim upon this mad river, I fixed my home. Here
have I toiled month after month, year after year,
increasing my golden store slowly and surely, but,
best of all, conquering that base appetite which lost<span class="pagenum">[120]</span>
heaven on earth for me, when its gates were wide
open.</p>

<p>“No beverage but that sparkling drink, which the
hand of the Father gives to man for his good, has
passed my lips for these three long years—water,
blessed water, has strengthened my brain and given
health to my body.</p>

<p>“And now, confident in myself, I would go back
and redeem my errors—go back to claim the hand
which had long, long ago been mine but for mine
own sin. Why will she not bid me come? I have
written three times, and have told her I am free
from the chains of the demon now; that I have
wealth enough to satisfy all reasonable desire, and
she has only written: ‘It is not time—perhaps you do
not yet know yourself.’</p>

<p>“Ah! could she but see me in this solitude—here
where I have lived alone so long—not a visitor, for I
have kept my claim and home a secret when I went
to the nearest post station, and no one has ever dared
to pass the chasm below, which cuts off this last
habitable spot in the gorge. They have not learned
my secret, or they might come, for the greed for
gold makes men dare all dangers.</p>

<p>“The sketch I sent her she received. Here is the
single line she sent in answer:</p>

<p>“‘The picture of your “Home” is here. God
help the lone one to keep his promises.’”</p>

<p>And the young man wept over the letters he held
in his hand. At last he aroused himself.</p>

<p>“Once more I will write to her,” he said; “I will
tell her how, apart from all men, visited by none—for
none can reach me till they know the secret of
my path—I have worked and waited, waited and
worked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[121]</span></p>

<p>“Once every three months I go out to carry the
gold I have gathered, and to place it where it will
not only be safe but draw an interest that adds to it
all the time. And once every three months I tread
streets where temptation glitters on every side of
me; yet I turn from it all with loathing, and hurry
back to my solitude, where my only company is a
memory, ever present, ever dear, of her.</p>

<p>“To-morrow I shall go again, and the deposit I
carry now will make my all—full three hundred
thousand dollars. I should be satisfied, but what
else can I do till I am recalled? Work keeps down
sad thoughts; work keeps hope alive; work gives
me life and strength to wait.”</p>

<p>He drew up to a rough table made of slabs hewed
out by himself, took writing materials from a shelf
overhead, and for a long time wrote steadily.</p>

<p>He was explaining all his life to her—all his life
in those dreary hills, and praying that she would bid
him come back to her with a renewed and nobler
life, chastened by toil and thought, made pure by
temperance in its most severe demands.</p>

<p>At last his letter was finished, folded, enveloped,
and then he drew from his finger a massive ring
with a sapphire in the set. Deeply engraved in the
stone was the symbol—two hearts pierced with an
arrow.</p>

<p>Dropping the red wax, which he had lighted at the
candle, on his letter, he impressed the seal, and it
was ready for its far away journey.</p>

<p>Now—long after midnight—he threw himself
down on his blankets to sleep.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">FRANK’S TALK WITH HIS SISTER.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Sister Lizzie, I want to talk to you. It is not your
regular bed time by an hour or more yet. Can you
be real steady, and thoughtful, and loving, for just
a little while?”</p>

<p>“I can try, dear Brother Frank. If I fail, why,
scold me,” said sweet Lizzie Legare, as she went
arm-in-arm with her brother back into the house,
after having seen Hattie and Mr. W—— off in the
carriage.</p>

<p>“Well, we will go to your boudoir, Lizzie. I want
to see you alone and to ask your advice.”</p>

<p>So they went to the little gem of a room, carpeted
in velvet, with flowers in every corner, curtains of
lace, chairs, ottomans, and a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tete-a-tete</i> all covered
with damask silk, and there they sat down, and
Frank commenced with a sigh—a long and heavy
sigh, and such a woe-begone look that Lizzie demurely
asked:</p>

<p>“Are you sick, dear brother?”</p>

<p>“No, but I’m worse off, Lizzie. I’m in love!”</p>

<p>“So am I.”</p>

<p>“I’m in love with Hattie Butler! There now!”</p>

<p>“So am I. There now!” and Lizzie laughed till
tears ran from her eyes, for she had imitated his
desperate “there now” like an echo.</p>

<p>“It isn’t anything to laugh at. I never was more
serious in my life,” he said, rather tartly, for he
thought she was making fun of him.</p>

<p>“Well, brother, you know I must either laugh or
cry all the time. But, seriously, if I was you I could<span class="pagenum">[123]</span>
not help loving that sweet, beautiful girl, and I believe
that, like you, I would forget that she was a
poor working girl. But, brother, what would the
fellows in your club, the fast, nobby fellows you are
always talking to me about, say if you married a
shop-girl?”</p>

<p>Frank answered with a shiver—not a word did he
speak. But he kept up a terrible thinking, and
Lizzie sat still and watched him.</p>

<p>At last he sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>“The fellows in the club can go to Halifax or anywhere
else they want to. If she’ll have me, and
father will consent, I’ll marry her inside of a week.”</p>

<p>“Inside of a church would be better, brother dear.
But those two provisos were well put in—the first especially.
When a gentleman wants to marry one
of our sex, the first and most necessary thing to find
out is will she have him. And I don’t believe you
have given her the first hint on the subject.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Frank.</p>

<p>“Nor even taken the trouble to find out whether
she either admires or cares in the least for you?”
continued Lizzie.</p>

<p>“That’s a fact.”</p>

<p>And Frank sighed while he made the admission.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think a little courting, as they call it,
in this case would be advisable before you talk of
marrying a girl whom you have seen but twice in
your life?”</p>

<p>“Sis, you are a philosopher in petticoats.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Frank, aren’t you ashamed to say so.”</p>

<p>“No, sister, for it is the truth. You are learning
me to be reasonable in this matter, and I thank you
for it. It proves the truth of the old adage that two
heads are better than one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[124]</span></p>

<p>“If one is a sheep’s head. Why didn’t you quote
the entire saying, Frank?”</p>

<p>“Because my little sister has a wise head, and
though I often tease her in my carelessness, I always
go to her for advice when I can’t see my own
way clear. I shall go to bed, darling, with a cooler
brain and a lighter heart, and if Miss Butler comes
often to our house to see Aunt Louisa, I’ll do just
the prettiest little bit of courting that you ever saw
done.”</p>

<p>“Good! It will be like a play to me.”</p>

<p>“Good-night, dear Lizzie.”</p>

<p>“Good-night, my darling brother.”</p>

<p>And thus for the night they parted.</p>

<p>Frank went into the library to ask the doctor, who
was there with his father, how his Aunt Louisa was
doing.</p>

<p>He learned that she was better, and sleeping
under the influence of an opiate. The doctor asked
of him, as he just had inquired of his father, whether
anything had occurred to particularly excite or
agitate Mrs. Emory when her attack came on.</p>

<p>But, as we know, neither father nor son had
taken notice of what she was doing or saying at
the time, the scream from Lizzie’s lips, and the exclamation
from Miss Butler, being the first warning
that they had when the lady fainted.</p>

<p>“I will be here early in the morning,” said the
doctor, as he arose to take his leave.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">“IT IS AS I FEARED.”</span></h2>
</div>


<p>When Hattie Butler went down to her breakfast
next morning she studied the features of little Jessie
Albemarle as closely as she could while the girl was
flitting to and fro, carrying coffee to the boarders
and attending to her duties. And once, when she
was close to her, she spoke to Jessie, and got a fair
look into her bright, brown, or hazel eyes. She was
almost startled when she did so, for she saw, sure
she saw, there a resemblance, a very marked and
strong resemblance, to the kind, loving eyes which
had greeted her the evening before at the house of
Mr. Legare, and which had closed so suddenly in that
death-like swoon when the name of “Jessie Albemarle”
was spoken.</p>

<p>While she was thinking of this, and what possibilities
might yet be in store for the poor, ill-treated
bound girl, Miss Scrimp opened her batteries on our
heroine.</p>

<p>“Miss Hattie,” she said, “I’ve been thinking of
changing my room down to this floor. There’s the
little alcove off the parlor, plenty large enough for a
bed for me, and my room has such a good light from
the east, you can almost feel day when it dawns,
and it would save you such a long journey up stairs.
I’ll only charge you a dollar a week more if you
take it. What do you say about it?”</p>

<p>“Only this, Miss Scrimp, that I am very well contented
where I am, and that I would much rather
pay my extra dollar toward getting you the silk dress
which Miss Kate spoke of yesterday, and which I<span class="pagenum">[126]</span>
am sure you deserve for the great improvements you
have made in your table.”</p>

<p>“That’s the talk,” cried Kate, from her seat. “I’ll
pay my dollar Saturday night.”</p>

<p>“And I—and I!” echoed along the table.</p>

<p>Miss Scrimp was quite disarmed by the turn that
Hattie Butler had given to her proposition. She had
been all ready to sneer out that “the richer some
folks grew the meaner they got,” but our heroine
killed the thought before it could be spoken.</p>

<p>And so Hattie got off to her work at her usual hour
without a change of rooms or a quarrel on the subject,
though Miss Scrimp had set her mind on having
one or the other.</p>

<p>The letter she had written in reply to Mr. W——,
his own inclosed in the same envelope to show him
that she would never keep such a missive for others
to see, even by chance, as she explained in a few
well-chosen words on the back of it, was in her
pocket, and she had made up her mind to give it to
him, unseen in his office, when she could make
some excuse for going there.</p>

<p>She arrived at the bindery at her usual hour, and
went at once to her table, hardly daring to look
around, lest he should cast his inquiring gaze upon
her.</p>

<p>She had left work unfinished there the night before,
and with a feeling of relief that she had not
seen him when coming in—for Mr. W—— had, with
manly delicacy, kept back—she went to work.</p>

<p>A step startled her soon after, and a flush was on
her face as it came near her, but the good-natured
voice of Mr. Jones, the foreman, reassured her, and
she answered a question of his in regard to the title
on some finished work promptly and pleasantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[127]</span></p>

<p>“The boss,” thus he always alluded to Mr. W——,
“don’t look well this morning. He was here very
early—stood at the door when I came to unlock it,”
continued Mr. Jones. “I suppose, like most young
single men nowadays, he keeps late hours, and they
don’t agree with him. For my part, home is dear
to me with what is in it, the blessed wife and baby;
so my hours are regular, my sleep sound, and my
appetite just what it ought to be.”</p>

<p>Having thus relieved his mind, Mr. Jones went on
about his business, little thinking that Hattie Butler
knew better than he why Mr. W—— did not look
well that morning.</p>

<p>For anxiety and suspense are death to sleep.</p>

<p>And Hattie thought, sorrowfully, if suspense
made him feel and look so ill, the keen arrow of
hopeless disappointment might work even a greater
change in his usually cheerful and happy face.
Therefore she dreaded to hand to him the letter containing
her decision, while she knew that the sooner
it was in his hands the better it would be for both
of them.</p>

<p>Several times she looked around to see if he was
making his usual morning tour through the shop,
but she did not see him. In fact it was almost noon
when she saw him come out of his office and go
around among the work people. And she saw at a
glance that, as Mr. Jones had said, he looked pale
and low-spirited.</p>

<p>Feeling sure that he would come to her table before
long, Hattie took the letter addressed to him
from her pocket, and laid it upon the corner of the
table, where his eye would be sure to fall upon it the
first thing when he approached.</p>

<p>And then, with more tremor than she liked, but<span class="pagenum">[128]</span>
which she could not for her life restrain, she went
on with her task.</p>

<p>It lacked but a little of the noon hour when she
heard his well-known step close to her table. And
she trembled when she replied to his kind salutation,
“Good-morning, Miss Hattie.”</p>

<p>At that instant his eye caught sight of the letter,
and his face flushed as he said, in a low tone:
“Heaven bless you for this quick reply,” snatched it
up, thrust it inside his vest over his beating heart,
and went as fast as he could go to his office.</p>

<p>Hattie never was so glad to hear the signal to
knock off work for dinner as she was then. For she
could not keep her eyes on her work. She was thinking
how he must feel when he read her letter, for
she had known what love was, and what disappointment
was, too, and she pitied him from the inmost
depth of her woman’s heart.</p>

<p>And he? Locking himself in his private office, he
quickly opened the letter on which he felt all his
future life depended. With pallor on his face he
read those words, written so kindly, yet blasting the
brightest hope he had ever cherished.</p>

<p>“It is even as I feared,” he murmured. “The flush
in her face when I returned that sketch which she
said had been sent to her by a dear friend, should
have told me not to hope, had I not been too blind.
The occupant of that wild mountain home—he who
is pictured as kneeling there above that rushing
river—is the happy man, and I—I have nothing on
earth to hope for.”</p>

<p>He folded her letter in his own, pressed it to his
lips, and placed it in an inner pocket over his
heart. And he sat there, silent and still, while
tears came in his blue eyes, and yet he made no<span class="pagenum">[129]</span>
complaint. To him she was an angel, but, alas!
not his angel.</p>

<p>He appreciated her delicacy and her noble sense
of honor in returning his letter, and he felt the full
value of the friendship she offered.</p>

<p>“But,” he said, “how can I, loving her as I do,
and must—how can I see her here day after day,
and refrain from pushing a suit which, under the
circumstances, would be almost an insult to her? I
cannot do it. I will go away. Father has been
anxious for me to establish a branch of our business
in California, and I will do it. Perhaps absence,
and the excitement and novelty of travel, will help
me to bear my disappointment better, if it does not
heal the wound inflicted so unwillingly by the
noblest hand on earth.”</p>

<p>For two hours or more he remained there in his
office, laying his plans and thinking what to do, and
trying to so tone down his feelings as not to pain
her when he went out, by a look of sorrow; and he
had regained entire command of himself when there
came a hasty knock on his office door.</p>

<p>He opened it to receive Frank and Lizzie Legare,
who stood there smiling, and who entered his office
when he as cheerfully saluted and asked them in.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">AUNT LOUISA.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“We have come after Miss Hattie Butler, Mr.
W——,” said Lizzie, after shaking hands with him.</p>

<p>“Our dear Aunt Louisa is ever so much better to-day,
and her first wish this morning was to see her.
But the doctor thought she had better wait until
afternoon, until she grew stronger, and so we
waited till after lunch, and then we had to come.
Our aunt would give us no rest.”</p>

<p>“That’s so. Do you know, Mr. W——, though she
has not positively said so in so many words, I believe
our good aunt means to give us a new cousin?
I feel sure she means to adopt Miss Hattie as her
daughter.”</p>

<p>“Hardly against the will of the latter, who has a
mind of her own, and few minds stronger or better
balanced,” said Mr. W——.</p>

<p>“But this morning,” said Lizzie, “when I went
early to her bedside, she was murmuring in her
sleep, and I heard the words, ‘my precious daughter,’
distinctly. And when she awoke, I knew she had
been thinking of Miss Butler, for she asked the very
first thing if she was in the house.”</p>

<p>“That certainly bears out your idea,” said Mr.
W——. “I will go and call Miss Hattie, and you
can state your wishes to her. She will go with you,
I know.”</p>

<p>“Lizzie, he is just one of the best fellows that ever
lived!” cried Frank. “Isn’t it a pity he is only a
book-binder after all?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[131]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t know as that sets him back in my estimation
one bit,” said Lizzie. “He is handsome,
manly, and well-bred.”</p>

<p>Frank looked at his hitherto aristocratic sister
with eyes of open wonder. What he would have
said had not Mr. W—— come in that moment with
Hattie, we do not know, for his lips were opened to
utter a reply when the book-binder and his fair employee
entered the office.</p>

<p>Then Frank had no eyes but for the latter, no
thought, for the moment, of any one else.</p>

<p>“Dear Miss Hattie!” was all that Lizzie said, as
she ran up to the poor bindery-girl, threw her arms
around her neck, and kissed her again and again.</p>

<p>Frank would have given his team of fast horses,
anything he had in the world, if he could have used
those very words and given the same salute, more
especially if he could have got the return his sister
did.</p>

<p>But he had to content himself by shaking her
hand, which he pressed quite warmly, as he said:</p>

<p>“I am glad to see you looking so well to-day, Miss
Hattie, after the fright our aunt gave you last
night.”</p>

<p>“Thank you!” said Hattie, kindly.</p>

<p>But Frank noted, with some chagrin, that she did
not return the pressure of his hand.</p>

<p>“We have come to carry you home with us to see
Aunt Louisa,” continued Lizzie. “She asked after
you the first thing this morning, and the doctor said
as she grew stronger to-day it would do her real
good to have a visit from you.”</p>

<p>“Then, if Mr. W—— can spare me, I certainly
cannot refuse to go,” said Hattie, with a smile.</p>

<p>“You certainly can be spared for such a purpose,<span class="pagenum">[132]</span>
Miss Hattie,” said Mr. W——. “Your time could
not be better spent than in comforting those who
need comfort.”</p>

<p>Hattie saw the hidden meaning of those words,
and she would have comforted him had it been in
her power. But she had made a decision in his case
which she could not change.</p>

<p>Mr. W—— now escorted his visitors and Hattie
down stairs to the carriage which waited, and when
the two girls sat side by side there, one resplendent
in silk, laces, and diamonds—the other in her ever
neat, well-fitting and well-made shop dress of ten-cent
calico, without an ornament of any kind, he
compared them in his mind, and his heart still told
him the shop-girl, beautiful, but poor, was superior
to all others in the world—his heart’s first and last
choice above all others.</p>

<p>And he stood there and watched them and the carriage
till it turned the corner, and then he went
back, with a weary sigh, to his business.</p>

<p>As the carriage rattled on over the paved streets,
so Lizzie’s tongue rattled, too, while Frank’s eyes
only were busy studying out the marvelous beauty
of the girl to whom his sister talked.</p>

<p>“Do you know, dear Hattie,” said she, “that I believe
we are to be cousins—real cousins. For if
Aunt Louisa adopts you as her daughter you will be
my cousin—my dear, dear cousin, will you not?”</p>

<p>“I fear I shall never be more than a dear and true
friend to you, Miss Lizzie,” said Hattie, kindly, yet
gravely. “Your aunt, perhaps, wishes to be as good
to me as you indicate, but I can never yield to her
kind desire.”</p>

<p>“But, Hattie, darling, you don’t know her yet.
She is so good! Never did a kinder heart throb than<span class="pagenum">[133]</span>
hers. She is the counterpart of my blessed mother,
who died on earth but lives in Heaven. She has seen
many sorrows—we know not all, for she was abroad
with her first husband for years, and we heard
he was a bad man. She married him against the
will of her parents and friends, but her last husband,
whom she married because they all wanted her to
after the first one died, was a very good man, and
he left her over a million of dollars in her own right.
We never talk with her about her first marriage.
She does not like it. But she often speaks of Mr.
Emory herself, and his praise never hurts her feelings.
We all liked him very much.”</p>

<p>Hattie was a good listener. She never interrupted
Lizzie’s narrative with a single question. And
a real good listener is a “rarity,” as Mr. Barnum
said when he found the “What is it.”</p>

<p>“Now you will think it over, will you not, if Aunt
Louisa proposes that you shall be her daughter, as I
know she will?” said Lizzie, stealing her arm coaxingly
about Hattie’s waist. “Don’t say no, dear—at
least not at once. For her sake soften a refusal,
if it must come.”</p>

<p>“I will do everything I can in honor and justice
to myself to make your good, dear aunt happy,”
said Hattie.</p>

<p>“You darling! I knew you would!”</p>

<p>And Lizzie, caring not a jot that they were driving
up the Fifth avenue, passing and meeting occupied
carriages all the time, kissed Hattie over and over
again.</p>

<p>And poor Frank sat there and saw their red lips
meet, and he wished he could be Lizzie, if only for a
minute.</p>

<p>But the sweetest moments must have their end.<span class="pagenum">[134]</span>
The carriage drew up before the Legare mansion,
and its occupants were soon within its stately walls.</p>

<p>Mr. Legare met them at the door.</p>

<p>“This kindness is truly gratifying, Miss Butler,”
said he to our heroine. “My sister is yet quite nervous,
but the doctor is confident your visit will be a
benefit to her. She is anxious to see you. I left her
but a moment ago, and she sent me from her
chamber to see if you had come. She wishes to see
you alone for a little while. I can almost guess the
cause of this wish, but I will not anticipate it to
you.”</p>

<p>Then, as soon as Lizzie had taken her bonnet and
shawl, Hattie went to the chamber of Mrs. Emory.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">“I AM THAT CHILD’S MOTHER!”</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Eagerly those brown eyes looked up as Hattie entered
Mrs. Emory’s chamber, and in the yearning
look, even in the features, Hattie recognized a resemblance
to Jessie Albemarle.</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you, Miss Butler. I am so glad you
have come,” said Mrs. Emory, in a low, tremulous
voice. “I have something to ask you, and then perhaps
a long, strange story to tell you in all confidence.”</p>

<p>“Your confidence, dear madam, shall not be misplaced,
and I will answer any question you ask, if
it be in my power to do so.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, dear, I feel that it is so. Lock the
door, please. I do not wish to be interrupted by any
one while we are together. Then come and sit here
close by my side. Do not fear that I shall faint
again. It was a sudden shock that caused it before;
but now I am prepared and calm.”</p>

<p>Hattie locked the door, and then seated herself,
as desired, close to Mrs. Emory.</p>

<p>“You spoke a name yesterday—a name very,
very dear to me,” said Mrs. Emory. “You see it
here, engraved on a golden necklace, which was
once worn by a little child.”</p>

<p>Hattie started in spite of herself. Was that the
necklace that Miss Scrimp had spoken of? For on
it she saw the name of “Jessie Albemarle” engraved.</p>

<p>“You start. Have you ever heard of this necklace
or seen it before?” asked Mrs. Emory, eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[136]</span></p>

<p>“If it was once on the neck of an infant left at
the orphan asylum by unknown parties I have
heard of it,” said Hattie.</p>

<p>“It was. Now tell me—oh, tell me quick, if you
know. Is that child yet living?”</p>

<p>“She is, dear lady.”</p>

<p>“Where—where—tell me, I implore you! I am that
child’s mother!”</p>

<p>“I have thought so ever since I met you, dear
lady,” said Hattie. “This very morning I was looking
in Jessie’s brown eyes and studying her features,
and I never saw a stronger resemblance than
you bear to each other.”</p>

<p>“This morning? This morning you saw her?”
gasped Mrs. Emory, trembling with excitement.</p>

<p>“Yes, madam, and you can soon see her. But
please be calm, or you will have another attack.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I will be calm. But the thought of seeing
her, knowing she is alive, is almost too much happiness.
Tell me, is she good, pure, like yourself?”</p>

<p>“She is good and pure, Mrs. Emory. For two
years and more I have seen her every day, and have
had the good fortune to render her more than one
kindness and to protect her from the abuse of a
cruel mistress.”</p>

<p>“Our Father in Heaven will reward you for it.”</p>

<p>“Did you not, nearly two years ago—I do not
know exactly the time, however—call at a house
where this poor girl had been bound out, to inquire
after her?” asked Hattie.</p>

<p>“Yes, I had just found out, by a long-concealed
paper, where my first husband, her father, had
taken her when I was helplessly ill. To get rid of
her care he pretended she was dead, and so I
mourned her, until at last, by accident, after his<span class="pagenum">[137]</span>
death, I found his confession, in which he stated
where he had left her, also that on her neck he had
left the necklace I had caused to be made when we
named her. I went there to the asylum as soon as I
could, and the matron gave me the address of the
woman who had taken her. I went there, and the
woman told me she had run away from her, and she
knew not, cared not, where she was. My agony of
disappointment threw me into a long fit of sickness,
and I had almost given up a hope of ever seeing my
child. The authorities at the asylum went to the
woman, and her report to them was the same as to
me. All I could get to identify my dear babe was
this necklace and some clothes I had made for her
to be christened in, which were on her when her
unnatural father took her away, and left her to the
charity of strangers. Oh, how soon can I clasp her
in my arms!”</p>

<p>“If you were able to ride, within the hour,” said
Hattie.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am well. I am strong now. Let me order
the carriage at once.”</p>

<p>Hattie saw that though she believed herself
strong she was yet very weak. Her pallor and
tremulous action showed that. And Hattie had
another fear. She knew Miss Scrimp would hide
Jessie away rather than let her go, if she could, or
dared to do it. And she was at heart almost bad
enough to do anything. And Hattie knew that there
must be a regular way to force Miss Scrimp at once
to yield up the poor girl, without Hattie herself
using the hold she had upon her.</p>

<p>“Can you ride with Mr. Legare and myself first to
the asylum, and get from the superintendent there
an order for the child as her mother?” asked Hattie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[138]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, yes—that is the way. My brother-in-law
knows the whole story, as I have told it to you, although,
for reasons of our own, we have kept it
from Frank and Lizzie.”</p>

<p>“Then let me ring for Mr. Legare. The poor girl
is at my boarding-house, and before the sun sets on
this day, please Heaven, she shall be in your arms.”</p>

<p>“Heaven must reward you. I never, never can!”
sobbed Mrs. Emory.</p>

<p>Hattie opened the door, called a servant, and in a
few moments Mr. Legare was in the room.</p>

<p>He wondered at the joyous light which shone in
the eyes of his dear sister; but the happy story was
soon told, and he now knew also that his sister had
fainted the night before when told she was looking
on the portrait of her lost child.</p>

<p>“The ways of Providence are inscrutable, mysterious,
but they ever lead aright,” said Mr. Legare.
“Who would have thought that my chance acquaintance
with Miss Butler, through those old books,
could lead to this happy result? My dear young
lady, we owe you a debt of gratitude which it seems
impossible to repay. Sister, take some refreshment
to strengthen you, and soon we will be on our way
to reclaim your long-lost loved one.”</p>

<p>And now Lizzie and Frank were sent in by their
father, for the story was no longer a family secret.</p>

<p>“You are to have a real cousin now,” said Hattie
to Lizzie, after the story was told.</p>

<p>“But she’ll not be like you. I shall never love her
half so well,” sighed Lizzie.</p>

<p>“She is a sweet girl, and very smart, for the
chances she has had. It will take but a little while,
with good teachers, to make her one to be really
proud of.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[139]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Legare and Mrs. Emory were now ready, and
with Hattie they went out to the carriage.</p>

<p>It was astonishing to see the change in the lately
invalid lady. New hope, new joys, new life beamed
in her eyes—her very step was elastic and happy.</p>

<p>“This is better than medicine. We’ll have to discharge
the doctor, and keep you with us,” said Mr.
Legare to Hattie, as the carriage dashed away to
its destination.</p>

<p>“We will keep her,” said Mrs. Emory. “I had
intended to adopt her in place of my lost child, and
now I will have two daughters instead of one.”</p>

<p>Tears arose in Hattie’s eyes, but she made no reply
then.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">REUNITED.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Miss Scrimp was in her dining-room, looking to
the lay-out of the table for the boarders when they
came to supper, which would be in an hour or thereabout.</p>

<p>Little Jessie, ever neat as far as she could be in
her person, now looked really pretty, for her new
eight-cent calico dress, though bought at a slop-shop,
fitted her slight and childish form perfectly,
and she had combed out her dark curling hair until
it looked like flosses of raven silk. The very pallor
of her little face made her dark, mournful eyes more
beautiful.</p>

<p>The girl was setting the table, assisted a little
now and then by Biddy Lanigan, who cut the
bread and meat, and Miss Scrimp was superintending
it all, when she heard a carriage rattle up to the
door, and a moment later heard the door-bell ring.</p>

<p>Miss Scrimp had not yet changed her dress for
evening, or put on her false curls. She thought Mr.
W—— might be in that carriage, as he had been before
when a carriage stopped with Hattie, and to be
seen by him, without her curls, would never do.</p>

<p>So she said to Jessie:</p>

<p>“Run to the door, and see who is there, while I
run up stairs and change my dress. If it is anybody
to see me, ask ’em right into the parlor and light
the gas there, for ’twill soon be dark enough to need
it, and I look my best in gas-light.”</p>

<p>Jessie opened the door, and a glad cry broke from
her lips when she saw Hattie standing there, and<span class="pagenum">[141]</span>
though two ladies and an elderly gentleman stood
on the steps also, she paid no heed to them, but cried
out:</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, good Miss Hattie, is it you? See my
new dress. It is the first I have had in such a long,
long time. If any one wants to see Miss Scrimp, I’m
to take ’em right into the parlor and light up the
gas. She has gone up stairs to fix up.”</p>

<p>“We’ll go into the parlor, dear; there are those
with me who wish to see Miss Scrimp, and you, too.
Run and light the gas.”</p>

<p>Jessie ran in, and Mrs. Emory, grasping Hattie’s
arm, gasped out:</p>

<p>“You need not tell me who she is; my heart
spoke the instant I saw her. It is my child—my
blessed child!”</p>

<p>“Be calm—come in the parlor, dear madam, and
let me break it to Jessie, or the poor girl will almost
die in her joy. She has had a hard life here. She
looks scarcely fourteen, yet she is two years older.”</p>

<p>“That is true,” said the matron of the asylum;
“we have the date of her coming registered.”</p>

<p>The three ladies and Mr. Legare entered the parlor
just as the blaze of the gas in three-bracket jets
came flashing out.</p>

<p>Jessie turned, and Hattie said, as she stood there
with a wondering look in her face:</p>

<p>“Jessie, do you want to be very, very happy? I
have brought a lady here who will love you so, so
much if you will only let her.”</p>

<p>Jessie looked at Hattie, then at Mrs. Emory, whose
eyes began to fill, and, with a wild cry, sprang half
way toward the latter.</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Hattie!” she cried; “tell me—isn’t this<span class="pagenum">[142]</span>
the mother, the dear mother I’ve dreamed about so
long—so long?”</p>

<p>“It is! it is! Jessie, my child, my love, come to
my arms!” cried Mrs. Emory, tears of joy rushing
in a flood from her eyes.</p>

<p>In a second mother and daughter sobbed in each
other’s arms.</p>

<p>Mr. Legare wept, too, and even the matron of the
asylum, hardened to many a scene like this, stood
with her handkerchief to her eyes.</p>

<p>Hattie alone, hearing a shuffling and well-known
step coming down the stairs, kept her composure,
for she knew she would need it all.</p>

<p>“Sakes alive! What’s goin’ on here? Who is that
that’s a-cryin’ over my bound-girl?” cried Miss
Scrimp, addressing Hattie, the only one who confronted
her.</p>

<p>“Hush, woman! This scene is too sacred for you
to intrude upon,” said Hattie, sternly. “There a
mother, a loving mother, weeps in joy over her long
lost child, restored at last by the blessing of God to
her bosom.”</p>

<p>“Her child? Why, it’s Jess—my bound-girl!”
sneered Miss Scrimp.</p>

<p>“Woman, she is your bound-girl no longer,” said
the matron of the asylum. “You deceived us when
once before we came here to find her, and falsely
said she had run away from you. Now, we, who
have the right, annul the indentures, and restore her
to her mother.”</p>

<p>“It sha’n’t be!” screamed Miss Scrimp. “She’s
mine by law, and I’ll have her, if I have to call in
all the police in the ward.”</p>

<p>“One word more, one single threat, and I will
call the police to arrest you, and never pause in my<span class="pagenum">[143]</span>
prosecution until you rest inside a prison’s bars,
there to stay for years, as you deserve.”</p>

<p>Miss Scrimp shivered from head to foot when she
heard those words, for she had for an instant forgotten
that she was wholly in the power of Miss
Butler.</p>

<p>“Oh, oh!” she sobbed, “this is the way my help
is to be taken from me after I’ve clothed and fed
her for years.”</p>

<p>“Starved and abused her, you mean—say not fed
and clothed. She has fed on scraps, slept on rags,
and if I must be a witness you will suffer now for
what you’ve done to her!” cried Hattie, too angry
to care to shield the wretched spinster in the least.</p>

<p>“Oh, hush! Don’t tell her that!” gasped Miss
Scrimp, for, as Mrs. Emory turned toward her, she
recognized the lady she had sent away with a falsehood
when that lady came asking for Jessie Albemarle.</p>

<p>“Miss Butler, you dear, blessed angel, will you
come home with Jessie and me? Come as her sister
and my child!” cried Mrs. Emory, taking no more
notice of Miss Scrimp than she would have done of
a plaster cast of some poor politician.</p>

<p>“I cannot go with you to-night, Mrs. Emory, but
to-morrow I will go to see you and your dear little
daughter. To-night you want her all to yourself,
and I have some writing which I must do.”</p>

<p>“Then, dear Miss Hattie, I will wait till to-morrow
to say what I cannot say now to you, for my heart
is too full. Come, Jessie—come, brother—let us go.
The matron will go with us; we will leave her at the
asylum as we go.”</p>

<p>Jessie ran and kissed Hattie over and over, and<span class="pagenum">[144]</span>
then turned and fixed a bitter look of hatred on Miss
Scrimp.</p>

<p>“You’ve whipped me for the last time, you toothless
old brute; you can wait on the table now yourself.”</p>

<p>“Come, Jessie; it is unworthy of you to notice her
now. Come, my darling.”</p>

<p>And Mrs. Emory took her child by the hand, and,
followed by Mr. Legare and the matron, went out to
the carriage—Jessie in just the clothes she had on
when they met, without bonnet or shawl.</p>

<p>And Miss Scrimp, speechless with impotent anger,
helpless in her rage, stood and saw them go, and
saw Hattie kiss Jessie and her mother in the carriage,
and then saw it drive off, and many of the
boarders, just coming, saw it, too, but not yet did
they understand it all.</p>

<p>“I s’pose I’m to thank you for all this,” said Miss
Scrimp, her cross-eyes fairly green as she snapped
her words short off, speaking to Hattie.</p>

<p>“If you thank me for anything thank me for the
mercy which yet keeps you out of prison,” said
Hattie, quietly.</p>

<p>“I’d like to kill you!” hissed the spinster.</p>

<p>“No doubt you would if you dared. But there is
an eye on you which protects me. So beware.”</p>

<p>Miss Scrimp shivered from head to foot, and
looked all around her as if she feared the hand of
arrest to be laid upon her.</p>

<p>Yet Hattie had alluded to that “All-seeing eye,”
which is never closed.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">“OH! I AM SO UNHAPPY!”</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Mr. W——, when he came to the bindery next
morning, knew all about the wonderful discovery,
the romance in real life, in which Hattie Butler had
borne such a prominent part. For the night before
he had gone to his club to try to wear off the melancholy,
which he did not want noticed by his loving
and keen-eyed sisters at home. And there he had
met Frank Legare, who took him aside and told
him all about it, giving Hattie all the praise of not
only discovering but restoring the long-lost one to
his aunt’s loving arms.</p>

<p>“She is a glorious girl!” said Frank. “That Miss
Hattie Butler, I mean.”</p>

<p>“She is, indeed,” said Mr. W——.</p>

<p>“As good as she is beautiful,” continued Frank.</p>

<p>“You are right,” said Mr. W——, smiling at
Frank’s enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“And do you know, Mr. W——,” continued Frank,
“that I love that girl with all my heart and soul,
and I mean to marry her?”</p>

<p>“Whether she is willing or not?” asked Mr.
W——, still smiling, for he knew only too well what
little chance there was for the young enthusiast.</p>

<p>“Why, you don’t think she would refuse me—the
heir to millions. And I fancy I’m not bad-looking
either.”</p>

<p>“You had better ask her, not me. She is the
party most interested,” said Mr. W——, quietly.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s so. But, some way, though she is<span class="pagenum">[146]</span>
only a poor girl, she has such a queenly way about
her that I’m almost afraid of her. I can’t talk to
her, familiar and free, as I can to most girls of my
acquaintance. But I know what I’ll do. Lizzie and
her are just like two sisters. I’ll get Lizzie to court
her for me.”</p>

<p>W—— laughed heartily at this idea. He had heard
of kings courting and marrying by proxy in Europe,
but the idea of a young American sovereign following
the example struck him as being very funny.</p>

<p>And it was.</p>

<p>Frank, rather annoyed at being laughed at,
dropped the subject, and turned to horses, where he
was quite at home, keeping a team himself that
could “spin” alongside of Vanderbilt any day. I
hope I’ve got that term right; I heard some young
men using it, I think.</p>

<p>And so, as I said before, Mr. W—— knew all
about the happy event when he saw Hattie come
into the bindery next morning.</p>

<p>Yet he was astonished to see her looking unusually
pale and sad, as if she had passed an unhappy,
sleepless night. Could it be that he was the
cause of it? It made him wretched to think that she
might be worrying because she thought her refusal
had made him unhappy. But he determined to be
as cheerful as he could, if such was the case. For
he knew that she respected him truly, even if she
could not love him, and he would not have lost that
respect for the world.</p>

<p>So he made his usual tour through the shop, trying
to be as cheerful and kind to all his employees
as ever, and finally he came to the table where Hattie
bent assiduously over her task.</p>

<p>“I was told last night, Miss Hattie, by young Legare,<span class="pagenum">[147]</span>
that you had discovered a cousin for him. He
was full of praises of you.”</p>

<p>“Yet it was not my act; I was but an instrument
in the hands of Providence to bring a long-abused
little girl to a loving mother. I feel thankful for
it, for I have pitied the poor child so long, and until
lately have hardly had a chance to befriend her as I
wished to do. But now she is safe. It will be
heaven on earth to her, this change.”</p>

<p>“I should think so. By the way, would you not
like to visit her this morning?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, not till afternoon. Then, if you will
spare me a little while, I would like to keep my
promise, and go to see both mother and child.”</p>

<p>“Take the time, Miss Hattie, and any time you
desire, with pleasure. I have instructed the foreman
in consequence of the nature of your new work,
you are to be entirely unrestricted, and no account
of time kept with you, though your salary goes on.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. W——, you are too kind!”</p>

<p>“No, Miss Hattie, and do not consider me so. The
new duties you perform are more valuable to us
than you conceive. So consider that it is the firm,
not yourself, under obligation.”</p>

<p>Hattie understood and felt the delicacy of his
thoughts and words, and appreciated the true manliness
of his heart; but she could only thank him—all
other reward must come from his own consciousness
of being kind to her.</p>

<p>Some way, during the morning, he had dropped
out his idea of going to California to the foreman,
and Mr. Jones, who had of late taken to speaking to
Hattie much more often than he had formerly,
spoke of it when he came to take some work to the
sewing bench, which she had collated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[148]</span></p>

<p>“To California! Is it not a sudden resolution?”
she asked, in wonder.</p>

<p>“Well, may be ’tis on his part. His father did
talk of sending me there, for he has long wanted to
set up a branch bindery to this on the Pacific coast,
but I kind o’ hung back. I love my wife and baby,
you see, and I couldn’t have afforded to take ’em
with me; and as for leavin’ ’em, I’d rather go down
to the paste-bench and work for half wages here.”</p>

<p>Mr. Jones was truly a family man, and it is a pity
there are not more family men like him.</p>

<p>“When will Mr. W—— go?” asked Hattie.</p>

<p>“Very soon—as soon as he can get off, he told me
this morning, but I don’t know as I ought to have
spoken of it, for he never cares to have his plans
known. But I know when I tell you anything it
will not get blabbed around.”</p>

<p>“No, I shall not speak of it to others,” said Hattie.</p>

<p>And now, when the foreman went away, she felt
more than ever wretched. Was he going to leave
his pleasant home, his dear parents and sisters, on
her account?—because she had thrown a shadow on
his life?</p>

<p>She could not bear the thought; she was determined
to speak to him. So, taking some work in her
hand, as if she wished to consult him, she went directly
to the office.</p>

<p>“Forgive me, Mr. W——,” she said, “if I intrude.
But I just learned that you had spoken of going to
California.”</p>

<p>“Such is my intention, Miss Hattie.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. W——, am I the cause of this sudden desire
to leave your happy home here—your pleasant
business? If it is, let me go away. I will never appear
in your presence again. Oh, I am so unhappy!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[149]</span></p>

<p>And tears fell fast from her dark eyes.</p>

<p>“Dear Miss Hattie, please be calm, and do not
blame yourself, for it is no fault of yours. But, believe
me, for the present it will be better for both of
us that I go. It will help you to forget my folly, help
me to bear my bitter disappointment. I would not
have you leave here on any account. So long as you
are here I can hear from you, know you are well,
and—that will be much happiness to me.”</p>

<p>“Mr. W——, you are too noble to suffer. Would to
Heaven I could save you from it. If you do go to
California I will intrust a mission to you which I
would not confide to any other man on earth, confident
that you will act for me as if you were a dear
brother, a true friend, as I feel and know you to be.
And in that mission you will discover what I have
held as a secret, sacredly, for over three years, and
it will help you to blame me less for the disappointment
under which you suffer.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Miss Hattie, I do not, have not, blamed you.
I know your reasons are good. Your noble heart
could not bid you act in any way but rightly. I will
undertake any service that you intrust to me, fulfill
your wishes sacredly to the utmost of my power.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. W——. A letter which I wrote
last night, with intent to mail, will be confided to
your care. And also written directions where to
find the person to whom it is addressed, and other
matters which I shall ask of you.”</p>

<p>“All of which shall be attended to with faithful
diligence, Miss Hattie. And now, please, wash your
eyes in the water-basin there before going out. I
would not have any one notice you had been weeping.”</p>

<p>“You are so good, Mr. W——!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[150]</span></p>

<p>Hattie’s heart was too full to say more. She
washed her face in the office basin, and then went
out to her table with a lighter heart, bending to her
work cheerfully, to do all she could before the carriage
came from Mr. Legare’s to take her to see Jessie
Albemarle and her mother.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE NEW HELP.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Hattie was bending over an old edition of Don
Quixote, in Spanish, which had been brought up for
binding—almost worn out, the cover gone, and the
leaves misplaced, when two hands, soft and small,
were placed over her eyes, and a voice, disguised,
cried out:</p>

<p>“Who am I?”</p>

<p>“Lizzie—I knew you by your rings,” said Hattie,
laughing.</p>

<p>“Oh, I stole up so still I thought you’d think it
was some bindery girl,” said Lizzie, bending over
and kissing her friend.</p>

<p>“No bindery girl would presume to take liberties
with me, dear Lizzie. I never mingle with them,
though I always treat them with courtesy when
chance throws them in my way.”</p>

<p>“I might have known it, darling Hattie. You are
not like them, or any one else that I know. I do believe
you are a fine lady, just masquerading at work
for a secret cause of your own.”</p>

<p>“Time will tell, Lizzie.”</p>

<p>“Well, I only wish it would be in a hurry about it.
But come, dear, I saw Mr. W——, bless his heart,
when I came in, and he said he had already told
you to take time to come to our house whenever you
wanted to. And, dear little Jessie, with dressmakers
and milliners all around her, happier than
anything else alive, only asks for her dear Miss
Hattie to come. She has told us how you fed her<span class="pagenum">[152]</span>
when almost starved, and how you gave her clothes
when she was in rags, and her mother says she’ll
pay you in love if she can do nothing else.”</p>

<p>“The love of true friends is very precious,” said
Hattie.</p>

<p>“And we are your true friends, and we will be
always,” said Lizzie, earnestly. “But come, dear
Hattie, they will wait for us. Frank is out in the
carriage. He would come along; but when he got
here, the lazy fellow wanted to stay in the carriage
instead of coming up. He said Mr. W——
was laughing at him for something that happened
last night at the club-room, but will not tell me
what.”</p>

<p>“Most likely your brother was boasting over his
new cousin,” said Hattie, putting on her things to
go.</p>

<p>“Yes, he did tell him about her.”</p>

<p>The two girls now went out, and in a few moments
were in the carriage, and on their way up town.
They stopped but once, then it was by order of
Frank, who went into a florist’s to get four large
bouquets for those in the carriage and at home.</p>

<p>“Oh, my Hattie! my Hattie!” cried Jessie Albemarle,
when our heroine went into the sitting-room,
where, with her mother, and surrounded by busy
cutters and sewers, she was being made presentable.</p>

<p>And she showered kisses on the only true friend
she had known in her many days of sorrow.</p>

<p>As lunch had been kept waiting for the arrival of
the carriage and its occupants, the family, as Mr.
Legare jovially termed them all, so as to include
Hattie, left the sewers and their work, and adjourned
to the dining-room.</p>

<p>Jessie, who seemed to come naturally into the<span class="pagenum">[153]</span>
ways of a lady, was almost too happy to eat, but
Cousin Frank told her she would never grow large,
stately, and beautiful like Miss Butler unless she
ate heartily.</p>

<p>It was a roundabout way to compliment Hattie,
but Frank, in his innocence, didn’t know how else
to do it. Some men are so awkward, you know.</p>

<p>“Did Miss Scrimp carry on much after I came
away?” asked Jessie.</p>

<p>“She commenced it, but I very promptly hushed
it. She said she would like to kill me.”</p>

<p>“And so she would if she dared. But she is an old
coward, Miss Hattie. No one but a coward would
beat a helpless girl as she used to beat me.”</p>

<p>“That is true, and were it not for publicity, I
would make her suffer for it to the full extent of the
law,” said Mrs. Emory. “But, Miss Hattie, you
ought not to stay another day in that house. Do
come here to stay with us. You need never work
again. If you will only come and be Jessie’s sister
you will overflow the cup of joy already full.”</p>

<p>“It cannot be at present, Mrs. Emory, though I
thank you from my heart. Three years ago I laid
out a certain course, for good reasons, which I hope
yet to be able to explain to you all, my kind friends,
and I cannot change that course until an event,
which I hope and pray for, takes place. Then, perhaps,
you will think all the more of me for the
course I have taken.”</p>

<p>“We have no right to ask more, Miss Hattie,”
said Mr. Legare. “I, for one, have every faith in
the purity of your motives in all things.”</p>

<p>Hattie could but be pleased with all these attentions.</p>

<p>After lunch the ladies adjourned to the sitting-room,<span class="pagenum">[154]</span>
while Mr. Legare went to his library. Frank,
with his new ideas of diplomacy, asked Lizzie if she
and Miss Hattie wouldn’t take just a little dash with
him in his phaeton behind his thoroughbreds.</p>

<p>Lizzie had been out with him once or twice, been
choked with dust or covered with mud, and she felt
no desire to try it again. She said she preferred the
family coach and steady driving.</p>

<p>As Frank would not go alone, he hung about the
sitting-room, and got well covered with lint while
he dodged about among the dry goods.</p>

<p>Jessie, who had never possessed a nice dress,
was in ecstasy with everything they showed her,
and Mrs. Emory had a double joy in seeing her dear
child so appreciative of everything done for her.
And the girl told such funny stories about Miss
Scrimp and Biddy Lanigan, mimicking them so
drolly, that she “brought down the house,” as the
critics say.</p>

<p>Hattie spent a very happy afternoon, dined with
the family, and was then sent home in the carriage
as usual. It was just supper-time at Miss Scrimp’s
when she got to the boarding-house, but the old
spinster was at the door when the carriage stopped,
her eyes fairly green with hate and envy.</p>

<p>Had not Saturday night been so close at hand,
and the money for the silk dress expected, there is
small room to doubt she would have had a “pick”
at Hattie in spite of the fear in which she held her.
As it was, she said, as Hattie passed her:</p>

<p>“Some folks ought to feel terrible proud to ride in
other folks’ carriages. For me, I’d rather go afoot,
when it’s my own shoes I walk in.”</p>

<p>Hattie made no reply, but she paused to say a kind
word to some of the girls who were coming in. At<span class="pagenum">[155]</span>
the same moment her eyes fell on the new servant
whom Miss Scrimp had hired to replace Jessie, for
she could not get another girl from the asylum. Her
record was already against her there.</p>

<p>This girl had just come over from the “Faderland”
far away. She was young and small, but
stout-built, and she thundered around on wooden
shoes, much to the amusement of the girls, as they
came in. She had not a very good idea of American
ways, spoke no English, and Miss Scrimp and
Biddy Lanigan had to manage her by signs.</p>

<p>The secret of her employment was this: She was
got from an intelligence office on a quarter of the
going wages, because she wanted to learn the English
language, and how to act as a waitress.</p>

<p>Hattie, having dined so late, did not care for supper,
so she did not stay to see Marguerite essay her
first trials at carrying round tea to the boarders, nor
did she know until after supper that the new girl,
stumbling as she carried two cups of hot tea in her
hands, deposited the contents of both down the
scrawny neck and bosom of Miss Scrimp, who,
screaming with pain, attempted to box her ears, but
got the worst of it in the struggle, for the girl tore
off all of Miss Scrimp’s false hair, and left her almost
bald-headed, besides damaging the arrangement
of the pads, which made up the best part of
her form. So Miss Scrimp learned that she had not
poor, helpless Jessie Albemarle to deal with now.
And as she had engaged this girl for a month, she
dared not discharge her without paying her wages,
so she drew off to her room to repair damages, and
left the new girl and Biddy to wait on the table.</p>

<p>And they managed better without her, for the
girl was willing and good-natured, and, after her<span class="pagenum">[156]</span>
first mishap, was more careful. Biddy, who had
got a hint from the girls that she was to have a
dress out of the proceeds of the subscription, bustled
around, and between her and Germany, as she
called the new girl, the supper ended pleasantly.</p>

<p>There was enough on the table, and the food was
good. Miss Scrimp had got started in it, and did not
dare to advance backward.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXII">CHAPTER XXXII.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">“SHE IS DYING!”</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Hattie was engaged that night, until a late hour,
over her writing-desk. A letter which she had already
written, enveloped, sealed, and stamped
ready for mailing, was opened, a long postscript
added, and then it was sealed with wax, and from a
tiny seal in ivory an impression was made—an
anchor and a cross, signifying Hope and Faith.</p>

<p>Hattie wept over this letter, and, after she had
sealed it, took up the mountain sketch we have alluded
to, and looked at it long and tearfully. Then,
with a swift, skillful hand, she copied this sketch on
a smaller scale on the head of a large letter-sheet.
Then, taking three letters from envelopes, which
all bore the pierced hearts as a seal, of which we
have spoken several times, she read them over and
over, and taking one, copied a portion of it beneath
the sketch which she had just completed.</p>

<p>“If he will undertake the mission, by this Mr.
W—— can be surely guided to that ‘Mountain
Home,’ and if all is found, as I hope to our Father it
may be, his mission will bring joy to a lonely heart,
perhaps sweep away the clouds that have so long
darkened my path; and then, absolved from my
vow, I can throw off the veil that I abhor, and once
more among my equals in the world take the place
which belongs to me. Surely I deserve it if patience
and long suffering ever met a reward.”</p>

<p>It was after midnight, by the tokens of the city
bells, when our heroine closed her writing-desk. A
brief time over her Bible, a little while at silent<span class="pagenum">[158]</span>
prayer, and then she lay down to rest on her coarse
and humble bed, contented with her lot, and not
for an instant regretting that she had refused a
home of affluence and the fostering care of rich and
loving friends.</p>

<p>At early dawn the loud, shrill calls of steam
whistles, blown to wake the workers in great establishments,
woke our heroine, and she was up and
washed, ready to breakfast with the rest at the usual
early hour.</p>

<p>Miss Scrimp, with her lean neck bandaged where
it had been scalded the night before, sat grim and
silent at her post. But the steaks were good and
well cooked, the bread soft and fresh, the coffee
strong, and all still went on as it had done since Hattie
held the finger of fear above the old maid’s head.</p>

<p>The meal soon over, the chattering girls wended
their way to their various shops, and Hattie, within
almost a minute of her usual time, went to her table
in the old book-bindery, which seemed almost like
a home to her.</p>

<p>Mr. Jones met her with his usual pleasant good-morning
as she went to her place, and other hands,
whom she knew slightly, bowed; but these were
the only recognitions. She had never made any
intimacy in all the long months she had worked
there.</p>

<p>Mr. W—— came in later, and went at once into
his office. Though Mr. Jones kept the time of every
hand, Mr. W—— always made out the pay-roll on
the morning of each Saturday, and in the afternoon
the hands went into the office as called, one by one,
and received their pay.</p>

<p>And that had been the custom for the many years
that the bindery, first under the father alone, and<span class="pagenum">[159]</span>
now under the father and son, had been kept running.
Never, in easy times or hard, had the practice
varied—never had a Saturday’s sun set with a
single one of their employees unpaid. No wonder
that good and steady hands remained there, and the
best work in all the great city was the result.</p>

<p>Hattie waited until the noon-day hour of rest came
before disturbing Mr. W——. She knew it was his
busy day, and she also knew enough to respect it.</p>

<p>If others were always as thoughtful many an employee
would be saved the sin of hard thoughts and
harsh words.</p>

<p>While the people were at their dinners, Hattie
took but a little while for her lunch, and with her
letters ready, entered the office.</p>

<p>Mr. W—- sat there, looking weary and sad.</p>

<p>“Do I disturb you, sir?” she asked, gently.</p>

<p>“No, Miss Hattie, you come like an angel of relief.
I have been working over Jones’ time-book, and
making out the people’s accounts. Permit me to
pay you now, so you will not have to come again.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir.”</p>

<p>And she took the money she had earned, and
signed the receipt-book, as she had done for months
and months, when her turn came, but under far
different circumstances.</p>

<p>After this was done, and he had asked Hattie to
sit down—for no one else would be called until the
dinner-hour was past, and the work call sounded—Hattie
took the letters from her pocket and opened
her business.</p>

<p>“You kindly consented to undertake a mission for
me, Mr. W——. It may be to you a thankless
undertaking. Yet, on the contrary, it may be a joyous,
gracious work. I have seen so much, suffered<span class="pagenum">[160]</span>
so much that I have little faith in the reformation
of man when he has once yielded himself a slave to
appetite and forgotten his manhood. If you follow
the directions laid down in a letter I have written
to you, you will deliver another letter to a man
whom I once believed to be the noblest of his race.
He fell, thank Heaven, before I was placed where
his fall could drag me down. I would not utterly
condemn and bid him go down, down, till he sank
forever in the gulf of shame. I wept over him while
I drove him from my side, and I prayed to him to
go where no one would know him, and there to lead
a new life. It was a terrible thing for me to do. I
loved that man with my whole heart and soul. You
may know some time who and what I was when I
thus sent him forth—let it suffice that I was not a
work-girl.</p>

<p>“He went. I have never seen him since. But at
intervals I have heard from him. It was he who
sketched the ‘Mountain Home,’ which you found in
my portfolio. He professes to have reformed entirely.
He says he is rich. I care not for his gold.
But if he is rich in temperance, in virtue, in honor,
in manhood restored and truth redeemed, I will
keep the troth once plighted.</p>

<p>“To you, dear, kind friend, I confide the task of
learning if this be so. I know you will do it without
one selfish thought or wish to warp your judgment.
And now you see my future is in your hands.
Take these letters and the sketch of the spot where
he writes he is to be found. There is a secret trail,
but the key to find it is in my letter.”</p>

<p>“I accept the mission. Manfully to him and
truthfully to you will I carry out your desires.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. W——. Look over my letter,<span class="pagenum">[161]</span>
and see if it needs any explanation. I will look at
the morning paper while you read.”</p>

<p>She took up the paper while he read the letter.</p>

<p>Suddenly he heard a gasping cry from her lips.
He looked up—she stood, pale and breathless like a
statue of despair, with her finger on one of the
“Personal” notices in that paper. At a glance, wild
and swift, he read these words:</p>

<p class="center">“G. E. L.—If you yet live, come to your mother
quickly—she is dying!”</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum">[162]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">“MY MOTHER IS DYING!”</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Great Heaven! what is the matter, Miss Hattie?”
he cried, as he saw her face turn whiter and
whiter, and her tall, graceful form totter and reel as
if stricken by a fearful blow.</p>

<p>“My mother is dying,” she gasped, “and I far
away, with forgiveness not passed between us,” and
she sank shivering into the chair from which she
had arisen.</p>

<p>And now, in a flash of thought, Mr. W—— remembered
where he had seen those initials before. They
were on the clasp of the portfolio which held her
drawings. Undoubtedly they were the initials of
her real name, and all this time she had been to him
only Hattie Butler.</p>

<p>“Miss Hattie, how can I assist you? If you desire
it, I will escort you anywhere you wish to go, leaving
when you desire, waiting for you, and keeping
sacredly any secret you may share with me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. W——, you are so good. Do not believe
me wicked, or reveal it, if I tell you that my real
name is embraced in those initials—that no wrong
doing of my own caused me to hide it under another,
but that I sought to escape persistent annoyance on
a subject I may not name now—sought to evade a
demand which wealthy and worldly parents made
of me.”</p>

<p>“Miss Hattie, I would stake my life on your goodness,
that every action of your life has been pure,
and marked by the noblest of purposes. Now, tell
me what I must or can do for you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[163]</span></p>

<p>“Grant me leave to absent myself a little while.
It may be two or three days—it can hardly be less—it
may be longer, and while I am gone, please go to
Mr. Legare’s and explain to him and his family that
I was called away at almost a moment’s notice. I
must take the four o’clock boat for Boston. I will
have time to go to my boarding-house, settle my
bill, and then I can take a carriage for the boat.”</p>

<p>“May I not escort you there?”</p>

<p>“For both our sakes, it will be better not. I will
be safe in a carriage and in the open light of day.
Do not fear. And, Mr. W——, I will, when I come
back, if you are not gone to California, tell you all.
I will withhold nothing from so good, so true a
friend. I go to the bedside of a dying mother. That
is what that notice calls me to. I will not condemn
that mother at this hour. But it was her pride and
obstinacy that forced me into a strange city to earn
my daily bread.”</p>

<p>“Do you not need more money?” asked Mr. W——.</p>

<p>“No, sir; I have enough in bills on my person,
and some in bank if I needed more; and I hold Mr.
Legare’s munificent check for those drawings. I
need nothing, Mr. W——, but your belief in my
honor and truth—your kind sympathy.”</p>

<p>“You have both, dear Miss Hattie—both to the
fullest extent. Go, and Heaven shield and bless
you. You will surely return?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and take my place here, no matter what occurs.
Here will I stay until you return from California,
and the result of your mission is made known
to me.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Miss Hattie. I will not detain you
longer, for you will have but little time for preparation
and to reach the boat. This evening I will go<span class="pagenum">[164]</span>
to Mr. Legare’s, and simply explain that you were
called away by the sickness of a relative.”</p>

<p>“Thank you; that will be enough. Tell them I
will go to see them when I return.”</p>

<p>A grasp of the hand, a tearful good-by, and the
honest, noble man, the pure, truthful woman, were
apart—he standing gloomily alone in his office, she
on her way, walking fast, toward her boarding-house.</p>

<p>Entering that, she found Biddy, Marguerite, and
Miss Scrimp all in the kitchen.</p>

<p>She handed Miss Scrimp the amount of her board
for the week, then giving her the additional dollar
for her silk dress, she said:</p>

<p>“I pay my part of the proposed subscription for
the silk dress, Miss Scrimp.” Then turning to Biddy
Lanigan, she said: “You have always been very
good to me, Biddy. Here is a five dollar bill for you
to use as you choose.”</p>

<p>“Long life an’ more power to ye, ye born angel!”
cried Biddy; “who could help bein’ kind to the likes
o’ you? Sure there’s not a lady in the land can hold
her head higher than your own.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Biddy. Now, Miss Scrimp, I am
going away for a few days, and shall lock up my
room, for I leave my trunk, books, and everything
except my little hand-satchel there.”</p>

<p>“Sakes alive! where be you a-goin’?”</p>

<p>“To visit a sick relative, and I shall return as soon
as I can.”</p>

<p>“Sakes alive!”</p>

<p>Those were the last words Hattie heard as she
turned and hurried to her room.</p>

<p>Half an hour later she came down dressed in a
traveling suit of heavy brown pongee, with a bonnet<span class="pagenum">[165]</span>
and shawl literally worth more than the entire
wardrobe of Miss Scrimp, her dress and her bearing
that of a lady.</p>

<p>“Sakes alives! Who’d have thought she had such
clothes here,” was Miss Scrimp’s exclamation, as
her “cheapest boarder,” as she had called her more
than once, left the door.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">HATTIE’S SEX DEFENDED.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>I don’t know why it is that the girls always read
those “Personals” in the paper. But I know they do.</p>

<p>The very minute Mr. W—— entered his father’s,
where he lived with his parents and sisters, his tallest
and prettiest sister, Flotie, came running to him
with the paper in her hand.</p>

<p>“Brother Edward,” said she, “don’t you remember
the initials on that portfolio of drawings you
had the other night—I mean the drawings made by
that pretty bindery girl of yours.”</p>

<p>“Why, what of it?” he asked, with well-assumed
carelessness.</p>

<p>“Why, they’re here in this paper. Read this personal:
‘G.&#160;E.&#160;L.—If you yet live come to your
mother quickly—she is dying.’ That must mean
your bindery girl. Anna saw it first and brought it
to me, and we had a great mind to send it down to
you, marked, at the bindery.”</p>

<p>“That would have been folly. There may be a
thousand people in the world with those very initials.
And, moreover, the initials of the girl alluded to are
H. B. Her name is Hattie Butler.”</p>

<p>“That may be an assumed name. The initials on
her portfolio were G.&#160;E.&#160;L., for we all saw it and
spoke of it at the time you had it here.”</p>

<p>“Very likely. Is dinner ready? I’m hungry as
an owl. And I’ve got to go out to make a call this
evening.”</p>

<p>“What, in the fearful storm that is just beginning
to rage?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I do not like the storm—it must be terrible<span class="pagenum">[167]</span>
on the water—but I promised to make a call at Mr.
Legare’s, and I never break a promise.”</p>

<p>“At Mr. Legare’s on Fifth avenue? He who has
a son in your club, and a pretty blonde for a daughter?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Flotie.”</p>

<p>“Well, I wouldn’t keep you from going there,
storm or no storm. You can go in the carriage. I’d
just go wild to have that girl for my sister-in-law.
The Legares stand at the very head of New York
society. But there’s the dinner-bell.”</p>

<p>“Mercy! how the wind blows. This storm has
come up very quickly—a regular north-easter,”
said the brother, with a shiver, and there was a
very anxious look on his face as he went to the dining-room.</p>

<p>His people always dined late, that they might
have his company after the day’s business was over.</p>

<p>At the table Edward W—— ate very little. His
soup was barely tasted, the fish passed entirely, the
“old roast beef” always on that table just apologized
to, and he would not wait for dessert at all.</p>

<p>“Why, brother, you said you were so hungry
when you came in,” said Flotie, opening her great
black eyes in wonder at his abstinence. “Has the
thought of that little blonde divinity driven away
all appetite?”</p>

<p>“What blonde divinity?” asked Anna, yet ignorant
of his destination that evening.</p>

<p>“Why, that pretty Miss Legare whom we saw at
the opera the other night. Her father is worth
millions on millions, and they descended from a
noble French family, I know, just by their looks
and the name,” answered Flotie.</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[168]</span></p>

<p>And that was all Anna said just then.</p>

<p>But she kept on thinking, and when her brother
kissed her and Flotie good-night, as he invariably
did on going out, she said:</p>

<p>“If you bring a nice, aristocratic sister-in-law to
our house, Edward, I’ll love you better than ever, if
such a thing can be.”</p>

<p>His answer was a sigh, for he was thinking of one
who even then was tossing on the angry waves of
Long Island Sound.</p>

<p>And putting on his overcoat, with an umbrella to
shelter him over the walk, he stepped into his own
carriage, which he had ordered out, and gave the
driver the number and avenue on which Mr. Legare
resided.</p>

<p>He found all the family at home, and met the
new cousin, whom he had never seen before. He was
warmly welcomed, and as Mr. Legare insisted on
his passing the evening there, he permitted him to
have his carriage and horses sent around to the capacious
stables in the rear of the mansion.</p>

<p>When he told them that he had been sent by Miss
Hattie Butler to tell them she had been called away
suddenly by the illness of a near relative, and that
even then she was on her way to Boston by the
night boat, every one of the family joined him in his
expressed anxiety about the storm—a wild, sleety
north-easter, which could be heard in its fury even
inside the marble walls of the grand mansion.</p>

<p>“Alone, without any escort; she’ll be just scared
to death,” said Frank. “I wish I was there.”</p>

<p>“You’d be worse frightened than she’ll be,” said
Lizzie. “She is brave—very brave, I know.”</p>

<p>“Pooh—she is only a woman, and all women are<span class="pagenum">[169]</span>
cowards when danger is around,” said Frank, in his
important way.</p>

<p>“Allow me to differ with you, Mr. Legare,” said
Mr. W——, promptly. “I believe that the female
sex, as a generality, have far more moral courage
than men. And what is physical courage but that
of the brute? Nine times out of ten those who possess
it hold it more on their ignorance of danger than
anything else.”</p>

<p>“There, Mr. Frank Legare, you’re answered, and
I hope you’ve got enough of it. Women cowards,
indeed! That shows what you know about them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I might know that you’d side with him,”
said Frank, petulantly. “But that don’t change my
opinion a bit, Miss Lizzie.”</p>

<p>“Frank! Frank! I really thought you were more
gallant!” said his father, laughing at the evident
discomfiture of his son.</p>

<p>“I might as well give it up since you’re all against
me,” said Frank, in a sulk.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not against you, Cousin Frank,” cried
Little Jessie, running up to him, “for I was the biggest
coward in the world to let that vile wretch,
Miss Scrimp, beat me, as she often did, when I
might have turned on her and scratched her very
eyes out.”</p>

<p>Frank laughed now. He had one on his side, any
way, and that put him in good humor again.</p>

<p>All this time Mrs. Emory had been sitting sad and
silent, listening to the storm which raged without.
For well built though the house was, the fury of the
gale dashing against the heavy plate-glass of the
windows gave a sign of what it must be out on the
unsheltered sea.</p>

<p>“Heaven be merciful!” she said, solemnly.<span class="pagenum">[170]</span>
“Heaven be merciful to those who are exposed on
this fearful night on the raging deep. God help those
who now are battling with the storm.”</p>

<p>“Amen,” broke from every lip. Even Frank looked
sad, and he was silent now.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">BATTLING WITH THE STORM.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Battling with the storm.” That was the very
word. For while those loving friends sent up a
prayer to Heaven for her safety, Hattie Butler, unable
to remain in her state-room, not afraid, for she
was truly brave, but anxious, had thrown a water-proof
mantle, which her satchel contained, over her
head and shoulders, and gone out on the deck near
the pilot house, where, holding on to one of the
great iron stays, she looked out on the wildly heaving
waters, listened to the howl of the mad gale,
and waited, with faith and hope, for the end, whatever
it might be.</p>

<p>By the light in the pilot-house, which shone on
the pale faces of the two pilots who stood at the
wheel, she also saw the calm but stern face of Captain
Smith, the commander of the boat, a veteran
in the navigation of the Sound, and she felt that he
knew his peril, and would do all that man could do
to save the lives of those intrusted to his care.</p>

<p>But it is not man who brings, or rules, or allays
the storm. The winds are in the hands of the Almighty,
and He is able to save when all else are
powerless.</p>

<p>She saw the mate pass her and go to the pilot-house
door. The captain asked:</p>

<p>“Is all right below, Mr. Glynn?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, so far. But it is a fearful night. I never
knew the steamer to heave and strain so hard,” replied
the mate, a tall, fine-looking young man, with<span class="pagenum">[172]</span>
a bare accent, not a brogue, to tell that he was a
son of Erin’s Isle.</p>

<p>“Have you had the pump well sounded?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I have given orders to sound them every
fifteen minutes, and to report instantly if there is
any gain in the water below.”</p>

<p>“Good! You are the right man in the right place,
Mr. Glynn. Tell Bishop, the engineer, to keep a
full head of steam on; we need every pound we can
carry to make head against this gale. The train at
Fall River will have to wait for our passengers or
leave without them, if this no’-easter holds stiff ’til
daylight.”</p>

<p>“I only hope we’ll live it through,” was what Hattie
Butler heard the mate say to himself, as he crept
away toward the ladder to leeward, by which he
descended toward the engine-room.</p>

<p>And then she saw the captain go and look at the
compass, and say to the pilots:</p>

<p>“Keep her up two points more to windward. We
ought to be near enough to Gardener’s Island to see
the light.”</p>

<p>“In this sleet, with the spray dashing as high as
the smoke-stacks, we’ll never see anything till we
are right on the top of it!” growled out one of the
pilots.</p>

<p>Was it not a Providence that made Hattie Butler
peer out at that moment from the shelter which the
pilot-house afforded her from the wind and rain—peer
out into the gloom and darkness ahead? It
must have been.</p>

<p>For close, very close, she saw what she knew must
be an artificial light, for through the inky clouds no
star or moon could have been seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[173]</span></p>

<p>Quick as thought she sprang to the pilot-house
door, flung it open, and screamed out:</p>

<p>“Captain, there is a light very close to us on our
left hand. I can see it out here plain.”</p>

<p>“On the port bow? Impossible!” cried the captain,
but he sprang out to see.</p>

<p>The next second he sprang to the pilot-house.</p>

<p>“Hard up the helm!” he shouted. “Ring the
stopping-bell, and then back the engine.”</p>

<p>All this did not take a second to say, and as quick
as it could be done every order was obeyed.</p>

<p>And as the great steamer came around in water
almost smooth, the captain came up and drew Hattie
Butler into the pilot-house.</p>

<p>“Young lady,” said he, “you have saved this
steamer and the lives of all on board. This night my
wife would have been a widow and my children orphans
but for you. Five minutes more and we
would have been head onto the rocks among the
breakers! What is your name?”</p>

<p>“Hattie Butler!” gasped our heroine. “Are we
safe now?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know just where we are, and can head
my course and make Fall River in the morning, but
perhaps too late for the train. If I was worth a million
dollars I would give every cent to you, for death
and ruin stood face to face to us.”</p>

<p>“Captain, I have only done my duty as an instrument
in the hands of God. It was He who sent me
from the state-room, where I could not sleep, up
here, where I could see the light-house when I did.”</p>

<p>“Heaven be thanked with you,” said the old captain,
reverently, and he bowed his head.</p>

<p>“If all is safe now I will go to my room,” said
Hattie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[174]</span></p>

<p>“It is. At breakfast I want you at my right hand
at table. We will be in smooth water then, please
Heaven. I will steady you with my arm as you go
below, for the steamer pitches heavily with her
head off, as it is, from the wind.”</p>

<p>And gratefully the captain took Hattie down to
her room, and then went back to his post.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXVI">CHAPTER XXXVI.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">SAFE IN PORT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Cap’n, that was the closest call I’ve ever had on
the Sound, and I’ve been on it, boy and man, for
five-and-fifty years.”</p>

<p>That was what the chief pilot said to Captain
Smith when he returned to the pilot-house after he
had seen Hattie Butler to her state-room, and taken
a turn to the engine-room and forward deck below
to see how things went there.</p>

<p>“How on earth did we ever get in so far, with the
wind holding where it did?” chimed in the other pilot.
“Our course ought to have kept us full five
miles farther out.”</p>

<p>“There was a stiff sou’wester all the night and
day before, and with the tide at ebb it made a terrible
current setting out by Montauk. I should have
thought of it. I headed well over for smooth water,
but not enough to throw us so far in shore, by ten
miles, rather than five. I’ll never forget this experience.
We have over four hundred souls on board,
and had it not been for that bright-eyed girl, where
would they be now?”</p>

<p>“Who is she, cap?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. She gave me her name. Hattie
Butler—that is all I know. She wears the dress, and
has the manners of a high-born lady; and, as you
saw, though the face was pale then, she is as pretty
as pretty can be.”</p>

<p>“I was too bad scared to look at her,” said the
chief pilot. “I’m hardly over it yet. The passengers
will make up a purse for her when they hear<span class="pagenum">[176]</span>
of it. If they don’t, they don’t deserve the luck
they’ve had.”</p>

<p>“She has begged me not to tell of it at all,” replied
the captain; “but I don’t see how I can keep my
mouth shut. And there are three or four newspaper
men on board, and they’d never forgive me if I
kept it from them. But I’ll not speak of it at the
breakfast table to all of ’em, as I meant to.”</p>

<p>The steamer was now heading her course, and the
wind going down a little, while the rain, that fell
heavier than ever, made the sea a great deal
smoother.</p>

<p>But the steamer was hours behind, and though
Mr. Bishop, the chief engineer, drove the firemen to
their work, the steamer could not make Fall River
within four hours of the regular train time. But
the captain told his passengers at the breakfast-table
that there would be a special train ready when
the boat reached her wharf to take them right on,
and he added that it was better to be late and safe
than early and in peril, adding a remark which he
credited to his engineer:</p>

<p>“I’d rather get to Fall River six hours behind time
than go to perdition on time.”</p>

<p>Only the reporters on board knew, and it had been
given to them on condition that they should not repeat
it there, how near to destruction they had been;
and the captain, with manly delicacy and honor,
had refrained from pointing out Miss Butler to them
as the heroine, thus saving her from the torture of
being interviewed.</p>

<p>At breakfast Captain Smith was very polite and
attentive to our heroine, but as he was always polite
to all his passengers that did not expose her.</p>

<p>At last the noble steamer, much to the joy of all<span class="pagenum">[177]</span>
on board, and of friends and agents on shore, made
her port, and ran into her regular wharf.</p>

<p>“Miss Butler,” said the captain, “when you return
to New York please take passage on my boat, and if
you purchase a ticket I shall feel hurt. The complimentary
card, which contains my name, will pass
you on the railroad at all times, and I want you to
think how much I owe you when you do me the real
favor to accept it.”</p>

<p>He was escorting her from the boat to the cars
when he said this, and she could not refuse to accept
his card, whether she ever used it or not.</p>

<p>In five minutes more the cars bore the glad passengers
toward the city so often called the “Hub”—I
hardly understand why.</p>

<p>And now I must draw a sorrowful picture there.
In a chamber in one of the most pretentious houses
on Beacon Hill, in the city of Boston, a lady hardly
past middle age, who must in health have been very
beautiful, lay dying.</p>

<p>A minister, two physicians, and several weeping
friends were near, and the former was speaking
words which he hoped would comfort her, or lessen
the agony of that dread moment.</p>

<p>The physicians had endeavored to get her to take
an opiate to lessen her pains, which were wearing
her out, but she would not, but kept crying out:</p>

<p>“Oh, my daughter! She will come—I know she
will come to forgive me before I die. I want all my
senses. I want to tell her what I have suffered
through my false pride. Her father is dead—died
praying that he might only see and bless his child.
And must I die, too, without seeing her? Oh, no.
God is too merciful. Pray—oh, pray, minister of
God, that she be sent to me before I die.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[178]</span></p>

<p>And her white, thin lips moved all the time he
knelt in prayer.</p>

<p>And before he arose to his feet, while the others,
kneeling, listened and wept, a wild, glad cry broke
from that mother’s lips.</p>

<p>“She is coming! My Georgiana is coming! I heard
a carriage stop at the door. It is she—thank Heaven,
it is my daughter!”</p>

<p>How a mother’s ear, even when that mother was
on her death-bed, could hear what no one else had
heard, how she could feel so certain her child was
near, is beyond our ken. But it was so.</p>

<p>A minute, scarcely that, had elapsed when the
door softly opened, and mother and child wept in
each other’s arms.</p>

<p>It was a holy scene. No word of recrimination, no
breath of the past, only this:</p>

<p>“Mother, dear mother!”</p>

<p>“My child! God bless my only child—my love!”</p>

<p>There was not a dry eye in the room—those who
had wept with grief before over a dying friend, now
wept with joy to think her eyes had not closed before
that meeting—that reconciliation took place.</p>

<p>But the physicians knew that the strength of Mrs.
Lonsdale could not last—that the spark so near gone,
flashing up, could last but little longer.</p>

<p>And the change began almost before they expected
it.</p>

<p>We need not say that Georgiana Emeline Lonsdale
was the real name of our heroine, but that was
the name of the dying lady’s daughter, and that
daughter was our heroine.</p>

<p>“Raise me up. Let me look at you. Oh, Georgiana—my
dear—dear child!” gasped the mother. “I<span class="pagenum">[179]</span>
prayed but to live for this—and—God has been good.
My will—here—under my pillow all the time!”</p>

<p>The physicians pressed forward. With a moan of
sorrow Georgiana pressed that wan face to her beating
heart.</p>

<p>“Mother—mother—live for me,” she sobbed.</p>

<p>“Bless—blessed—child—thank God!”</p>

<p>“She lives forever in a brighter world,” said the
minister, with touching solemnity.</p>

<p>And our heroine, yet clasping that form, so dear
that nothing of the past could come to mind, looked
down on a smiling face frozen in the still snow of
death.</p>

<p>Gently the kind friends removed her clasp, tenderly
the good pastor said:</p>

<p>“Blessed is He who gives. Blessed is He who
takes away.”</p>

<p>Long, long the poor girl wept, and would not be
comforted. What to her was the costly mansion,
furnished as few other houses in the city were
adorned? What to her a bank account second to
few in Boston? What to her, horses, carriages, old
family plate, jewels that had been owned generation
after generation by her ancestors, now all her own?
Her father, ever kind, her mother, with whom she
had parted in anger when she chose a heart’s idol,
all too early cast down, were gone—forever gone
from earth.</p>

<p>It was well her sorrow found relief in tears. She
wept until exhausted, and then herself needing a
physician, she sank to sleep. She had not till then
slept one moment since the night before she started
from New York.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">HOW THE NEWS WAS RECEIVED.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Mr. W—— was up and out bright and early that
Sunday morning, anxious to see the Sunday papers,
daily and weekly, most of which he knew did not
go to press till late in the night, or rather early in
the morning, and he hoped from these to hear something
about the storm on the Sound—something to
assure him of the safety of the one who was first
and foremost in his thoughts. All that he could
find in these papers was that just as they were closing
up their columns to go to press a fearful gale
was blowing from the northeast, and that disasters
on the Sound and all along the Atlantic coast might
be expected. But none had been heard from yet.
All the Sound line steamers left at their regular
hour, and must meet and face the gale en route.</p>

<p>And this was all he could learn without telegraphic
news came of sufficient importance to cause
the issue of extras. Nervously he watched for these,
and at last, not far from noon—a little after it—he
heard a street Arab shouting:</p>

<p>“’Ere’s yer extra. ’Ere’s news o’ the big storm!”</p>

<p>He rushed out into the street, tore a paper out of
the hand of the yelling urchin, threw him a quarter,
and then read the heading in startling capitals:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[181]</span></p>

<p class="center largefont p1">TERRIBLE STORM!</p>

<p class="center">OUR OWN REPORTER WAS ON BOARD THE ENDANGERED<br />
AND NEARLY WRECKED STEAMER.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p class="center smallfont">[Full Particulars by Telegraph.]</p>

<p>For a little while he was so blinded that he could
not read another word, a mist seemed to come between
him and the paper. But in a little time a reaction
came. He grew calm, and then he read a
long and thrilling telegraphic report of the storm,
how the vessel, swept by adverse currents, ran far
out of her course, and while battling with a most
terrible tempest in a sea which deluged her decks,
was on the very point of running on shore, when a
young lady who had preferred to watch the wild
grandeur of the storm rather than to rest in the
shelter of her state-room, had, while clinging to the
stays near the pilot-house, discovered the danger
neither pilots nor captain could see, rushed to the
pilot-house and given the alarm only barely in time
to have the course altered, the engines reversed, and
the boat backed.</p>

<p>The name of the heroine who had saved the vessel
and so many precious lives was Miss Hattie Butler,
a passenger going from New York to Boston.

out in full by the reporter who had witnessed all
that had occurred, and would interview the lady if
possible.</p>

<p>“She is safe! Oh, I thank the gracious Father
she is safe!” was all that Edward W—— said.</p>

<p>Her life, even though she might never be his, was
more precious by far to him than his own.</p>

<p>The news was too good to keep. He knew that
there were others who would rejoice to hear it. He
hailed and engaged a passing cab, and with the
paper yet clasped in his hand, ordered the driver to
go as fast as he could to No. — Fifth avenue. The
more haste he made the better he would be paid.</p>

<p>Any one who knows what a New York cabman is
can fancy how those poor old horses were lashed
forward under that promise. Mr. Bergh, luckily for
the driver, did not see him, and thus in about half
an hour Mr. W—— stood on the steps of the Legare
mansion, and the cabman drove back at a slow walk
with a ten-dollar bill in his pocket, about one-fifth
of which would reach his employer’s hands that
night when he rendered in his day’s work.</p>

<p>In a few seconds Mr. W—— was in the library,
where the servant told him he would find Mr. Legare,
and by the time he got there Frank, Lizzie,
Mrs. Emory, and even Little Jessie were in the room,
for they had seen him alight from the cab, and
feared he had brought bad news.</p>

<p>“Have you heard from Miss Butler? Is she safe?”
cried Mrs. Emory.</p>

<p>“Don’t speak if she’s lost—don’t—don’t!” screamed
Lizzie, for, seeing how pale he looked, she feared the
worst.</p>

<p>“If she’s dead I’ll die, too,” moaned Frank.</p>

<p>“She is not only safe, but her heroism has made<span class="pagenum">[183]</span>
her immortal. She has saved over four hundred
lives,” cried Mr. W——, waving the paper in his
hand. “I came as fast as I could to be the first to
bring the glad news.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you dear, dear fellow!” screamed Lizzie, and
she threw both her white plump arms about his
neck, and kissed him again and again.</p>

<p>“I don’t care if all the world sees me,” she added,
as Frank cried out:</p>

<p>“Oh, Lizzie!”</p>

<p>And Little Jessie kissed Mr. W——, too, and cried
while she did it, and no doubt Mrs. Emory would
have willingly done the same if it would have done
him any good and been within the bounds of propriety.</p>

<p>Mr. Legare said in his happy way:</p>

<p>“Bless my soul, Mr. W——, you seem to have
turned the folks all topsy-turvy, but I don’t blame
you. The news is gloriously good. I always liked
that girl. And, mark me, she’ll turn out to be something
more than a bindery girl yet.”</p>

<p>“You just bet she will,” cried Frank. “If I knew
where to find her I’d go to Boston to-night.”</p>

<p>“What for, Frank?” asked his sister, now completely
herself again.</p>

<p>“To tell her you kissed Mr. W—— right before us
all,” said Frank, determined to get even with Lizzie
now if he could.</p>

<p>“You might tell her, too, while you were about
it, that I was only sorry he didn’t kiss me back,”
said Lizzie, so saucily that the laugh was all on her
side.</p>

<p>“But really, Mr. W——,” she added, “you must
think I was very bold. But, to tell the truth, I
thought at first you had come to tell us she was<span class="pagenum">[184]</span>
dead, and when I heard you say she was safe I was
so glad that I really didn’t know what I was doing.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that is a likely story, when you were cool
enough to notice that he didn’t kiss you back
again,” cried Frank.</p>

<p>“An oversight for which I humbly beg pardon,”
said Mr. W——.</p>

<p>Frank was even now, and Mr. W—— had helped
him, for which the young man felt decidedly grateful.</p>

<p>Lizzie acknowledged the victory, for she blushed,
and made no reply.</p>

<p>Mr. W—— now read the entire report aloud, and
said he had no doubt the fullest particulars would be
had in the morning papers.</p>

<p>“Dear me,” sighed Frank, when he heard this,
“she will be made so much of now in Boston where
live heroines are scarce, that I’m afraid she’ll never
come back to see us.”</p>

<p>Mr. W—— whispered something to Lizzie, who
laughed heartily, and then said:</p>

<p>“Frank, if she only knew you were just dying to
see her—you, the heir to millions, and not so bad
looking either—she’d never sleep till she got here.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you traitor! you told her just what I said to
you at our club-rooms,” said Frank, shaking his
finger at Mr. W——.</p>

<p>And so Lizzie had the laugh on her side now.</p>

<p>Mr. Legare insisted on Mr. W—— remaining to
dinner, and then he would take him home in his own
carriage.</p>

<p>Lizzie, with an appealing look, joined in the invitation,
and Mr. W—— remained.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">AN IMPORTANT DISPATCH.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>When Edward W—— got home that night he
found two angry girls up to meet him. His sisters,
Flotie and Anna, their dark eyes flashing, each with
an “extra” in her hand, met him as he entered the
sitting-room in his usual quiet way.</p>

<p>“So! So, Master Ned! you think you can keep a
secret from us, don’t you?” cried Flotie, shaking the
paper in his face.</p>

<p>“Yes; we asked you if the ‘G. E. L.’ who was
wanted to go to a dying mother wasn’t your Hattie
Butler, and here she turns out a heroine on a Boston
steamer. Oh, you hypocrite! you knew all about
her going all the time.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll wager a box of gloves you did,” said
Flotie.</p>

<p>“Now, own up, and we’ll forgive you,” said Anna,
in a coaxing tone.</p>

<p>“What do you want me to own up, sis?”</p>

<p>“That G. E. L. and Hattie Butler are one and the
same,” said Flotie. “You needn’t deny it, for we’re
sure of it.”</p>

<p>“Well, if it will make you any happier, let it go
so.”</p>

<p>“And that you knew she was going on that very
boat,” added Anna.</p>

<p>“If that will set your mind any more at ease, I
knew it.”</p>

<p>“Then why didn’t you tell us last night?” said
Flotie, and her big black eyes fairly snapped.</p>

<p>“And why did you leave it just to chance for us to<span class="pagenum">[186]</span>
find it out? We saw you buy an extra, and call
a cab, and drive off like mad up town, and we each
got one; and so you see you are caught, Master Edward.”</p>

<p>“So it appears. Have you done with your catechism?
If so I’ll go to my room and prepare for
rest.”</p>

<p>“We’re not done yet,” said Flotie. “What name
do the initials G. E. L. stand for?”</p>

<p>“I do not know.”</p>

<p>“Brother Edward, that fib will never do. If you
know a part of her secret you know all.”</p>

<p>“You are very much mistaken, my sister. I know
but little, very little, of Miss Butler or her life beyond
the bindery, and the little I do know she has
given me confidentially, and so it will be kept.”</p>

<p>“Very well, sir. Good-night. You can go to bed
without your kiss.”</p>

<p>“The punishment is severe, sister dear, but I submit.”</p>

<p>And Edward marched away to his room smiling,
while his sisters pouted, yet wanted to call him back
for the kiss of affection which never was forgotten
when they were about to separate for the night.</p>

<p>The next morning Mr. W—— rose unusually early,
took his coffee and a slice of toast, and left the
house on his way to the bindery before his sisters
were up.</p>

<p>He bought a paper at the nearest news-stand, and
while riding down town in a street car read a long
and well-written narrative of a sub-editor’s experience
in a storm.</p>

<p>The heroism of Miss Hattie Butler, and the modesty
which made her refuse to be interviewed or in
any way recompensed for what she had done, was<span class="pagenum">[187]</span>
commented on in brilliant terms. She had done this
incalculable service, and then completely withdrawn
from notice, and no one knew whither she
had gone.</p>

<p>“It was so like her.”</p>

<p>That was all Mr. W—— said. But in it he paid
her the highest compliment.</p>

<p>He found, on his arrival at the bindery, all who
had come, the foreman and a good part of the hands,
in a great state of excitement.</p>

<p>They had all seen either the extras of the day before,
or got the morning papers. And the question
among them all was, was the Hattie Butler alluded
to the one who worked in the bindery. None of
them, not even the foreman, had known of her leaving
town, for Mr. W——, on Saturday night, had not
thought it necessary to speak of it, and would not
have done so now, except to his foreman, but for
the questions of his work-people.</p>

<p>But now, with a pride he had no wish to control,
he told them it was their Hattie Butler—that she
had been suddenly called away to the bedside of a
sick relative in Boston, and that she was on the boat
when she played the heroine so grandly.</p>

<p>It was a wonder to see how proud those poor shop-workers
felt. That one of their own class, as they
regarded her, should suddenly become so famous,
seemed like an individual triumph to each of them.</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Edward W—— here?” cried a messenger-boy,
rushing up to the door. “Here’s a dispatch
from Boston—marked private and very important!”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum">[188]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXIX">CHAPTER XXXIX.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">MR. JONES PROMOTED.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“A dispatch for me?” cried Mr. W——.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Here it is, prepaid, O. K., all hunky,
and so forth,” cried the lad, and as Mr. W—— took
the dispatch, away he went, on the run, to deliver
more.</p>

<p>Mr. W——, to the disappointment of Mr. Jones
and the others, did not open and read his dispatch
then and there, but, with a pale face, and quick,
nervous step, went with it, unopened in his hand,
to his office, and shut himself in. And there he read
these strange and startling words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="ir2">“<span class="smcap">No. — Beacon St., Boston.</span></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Kindest of Friends</span>:—Both my parents are dead.
My mother, reconciled, died, blessing me. There is
a very large estate to receive, and I alone can arrange
for its care in my absence, for I shall return
to my position, and occupy it until you return, successful
or not, from that mission to California. Pardon
the suggestion that you go on immediately.
You will find me at the bindery when you come
back. Keep the confidence I bestowed upon you,
especially as to what I send in this dispatch, even
from the friends on Fifth avenue. Only say to all I
am well, and will soon return.</p>

<p class="center pminus1" style="padding-left:10em">“Faithfully yours,</p>

<p class="center pminus1" style="padding-left:15em">“G. E. L.”</p>

<p>“[Answer.]”</p>
</div>

<p>“Wonderful! What a comprehensive dispatch!”
murmured Mr. W——, as he folded it and placed it
inside his pocket-book.</p>

<p>And, writing this answer, he sealed and sent it at
once to the telegraph office:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[189]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“G. E. L., <span class="smcap">No. — Beacon St., Boston</span>:</p>

<p>“Your dispatch received. Every wish expressed
shall be faithfully carried out. I will leave to-morrow
for California, and return as soon as my mission
is fulfilled.</p>

<p class="ir2 pminus1">“<span class="smcap">Edward W——.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>And when the dispatch was gone, Mr. W——
went out to his foreman, and said:</p>

<p>“Mr. Jones, I have heard from Miss Butler. She
is well. Her mother is dead. She will remain in
Boston a few days, and then return to her duties
here. You are at liberty to say this to our people
here. To-morrow I shall leave for California, to establish
a branch bindery there. You will remain in
charge here. Father will come down to see you
once in a while, perhaps; but he will not interfere
with the work. When Miss Butler returns give her
all the time she wishes out of the bindery, and make
her duties easy and pleasant as you can. She is a
noble girl.”</p>

<p>“That she is, Mr. W——. I’m sorry you are going,
but I will do my very best while you are gone, and
try to keep everything moving brisk and right.”</p>

<p>“I know you will, Mr. Jones. I have every confidence
in you. I also increase your wages on the
pay-roll ten dollars a week in consequence of your
increased responsibilities. Miss Butler had better
come into the office with her work now, and she
will help you with the pay-rolls. I shall leave checks
to an amount which will keep you square with the
hands, no matter what comes in. If more stock is
wanted father will see to it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. W——, you are too good. Ten dollars a
week more will make the little woman at home feel
as rich as a Vanderbilt.”</p>

<p>“So much the better, Mr. Jones. Your baby is<span class="pagenum">[190]</span>
growing, and so will your expenses increase. Go on
with everything. I have a great deal to do to get
ready—have to go home, and up town to see Mr.
Legare, and shall be out most of the day.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do my best, sir, and I think I’ll please you,”
said the happy foreman, as he turned and left the
office.</p>

<p>Within ten minutes the news had spread all over
the shop. There was a little buzz of excitement, but
the discipline of the establishment was perfect, and
the work went on as steadily and smoothly as ever.</p>

<p>Mr. W—— spent an hour or more over his books
and pay-rolls, then he wrote and sealed a long letter,
which was to be given to Miss Butler when she returned,
and a separate open note, asking her to take
a table in the office when she came back, and to
help Mr. Jones with his accounts and pay-rolls.</p>

<p>This done, Mr. Jones was again called, the letters
handed to him, all explanations made, and then Mr.
W—— left for his home to make preparations there,
and have a small trunk packed with necessary
clothing, and to go up to Fifth avenue to carry the
news, which he was permitted to reveal, from Miss
Butler, as she was still to be known until she chose
to throw off her incognito, and to tell them of his
sudden intention to leave for California, to there
extend his business.</p>

<p>His own family, having often discussed this trip to
California, were not at all surprised at his decision
to start at once, for he was one of those prompt, decisive
men in business who take things sharply and
move without making any noise about it.</p>

<p>His father gave him a little advice, and an unlimited
letter of credit.</p>

<p>His sisters wept a little, but packed his trunk<span class="pagenum">[191]</span>
nicely, for though they often had little jars with
him, he was a good brother, and very dear to them.</p>

<p>When he had seen to all these things, and knew
that he was ready to start on the earliest train next
day, he took the carriage and rode up to the mansion
of Mr. Legare.</p>

<p>All were at home, and his welcome, as usual, was
cordial.</p>

<p>“Any further news from my dear, dear friend?”
was the first question that left the lips of Lizzie.</p>

<p>“Of course he has. She’d let him know how she
was, before any of us!” said Frank, almost too jealous
to live.</p>

<p>“As her oldest acquaintance in the city, perhaps
she thinks me the one that she ought to communicate
with, especially as her business is with our
firm,” said Mr. W——, gravely. “But in a dispatch
that I received this morning, announcing the death
of her mother, and asking a few days longer leave
of absence, in consequence, she begged me especially
to come up here, tell her friends she was well,
and would soon return to New York, and would
make her first and only call away from business on
them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you—thank you, Mr. W——. All read
the paper this morning. Frank says he don’t know
hardly how to begin, but he means to write a romance
about it. He is going to call it ‘The Angel
of the Storm; or, The Pilot’s Timely Warning.’”</p>

<p>“That will sound very grand,” said Mr. W——,
with a smile. “It seems to me I saw a dime novel,
published by one of our city small fry, called ‘The
Angel of the Washtub—a Romance of Soap-Suds
and Starch.’ It must have sold hugely.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[192]</span></p>

<p>“There you are laughing at me again!” said
Frank.</p>

<p>“No, brother, he is only encouraging you in your
first literary effort. Every one must have a start,
you know, even if it is down hill.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Emory came into the room now with Jessie,
and the latter ran and shook hands with the friend
of her dear Hattie.</p>

<p>Mr. W—— told Mrs. Emory that he had heard from
Hattie. She was well, and would soon return, and
then, the elder Legare coming in, he broached the
subject of his going to California.</p>

<p>Frank’s eyes flashed joyfully when he heard of it,
for he was, in truth, fearfully jealous of Mr. W——,
and he thought if the latter was absent he might
stand some chance to win the affections of Hattie,
whom he thought he loved more than ever since
her heroism had made her famous.</p>

<p>Lizzie seemed sorry, and asked if his intention had
not been formed suddenly. But he told her it had
not. His father had long desired to have him go,
and he had come to the conclusion that the sooner
he went the better.</p>

<p>He spent but an hour there with those pleasant
friends, and then, on the plea of preparing for his
departure, bade them farewell.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XL">CHAPTER XL.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">CAPTAIN SMITH.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Hattie—or, as we should call her in her own
home, Georgiana Lonsdale—with her force of
character, knew that it was wrong to give way to
unavailing grief, and with a strong effort she
aroused herself to the action so necessary after her
mother’s death.</p>

<p>The family physician, and the attorney who had
done her father’s business for years before he died—both
old and true friends—and the clergyman also,
offered all the aid in their power, and the funeral
ceremonies were arranged according to the desire of
the deceased lady as expressed in her will, found
where she had told her daughter it was, almost with
her last breath.</p>

<p>As we already know, Miss Lonsdale, under her
own initials, telegraphed to Mr. W—— the moment
she was able to think what she could and should do.</p>

<p>After her mother was buried by the side of her father
in the family cemetery, Georgiana at once began
to arrange everything for an absence again, for
a time, from her home. She caused two bequests
of her mother, to charitable institutions, to be paid,
even before the legal steps of administration were
complied with, so anxious was she to carry out her
mother’s desire.</p>

<p>Leaving the care of the estate to the long tried
and faithful attorney, she arranged that with only
servants to keep the house in order, and ready for
her occupancy when she came, the old housekeeper
should remain there. The carriages were stored in<span class="pagenum">[194]</span>
the carriage-house, and the horses all sent off to be
kept on a farm near Amherst, which belonged to
the estate, the old family coachman going along to
take care of them until he should be wanted again
on Beacon Hill.</p>

<p>Georgiana took sufficient time for all these details,
for she felt at rest in her mind after she received
the telegram from Mr. W——.</p>

<p>When everything was arranged to suit her,
dressed plainly but very neatly in her mourning
garments, she made ready to return to her humble
position, and to carry out the plans which she had
laid down.</p>

<p>Captain Smith, standing by the gangway-plank of
his steamer, was surprised one day to see her come
on board, and grasping her extended hand, he cried
out:</p>

<p>“Heaven bless you, young lady. There’s a little
woman who never goes to bed at night now, without
a thankful prayer on her lips for Miss Hattie Butler,
who saved a loving husband for her. And a girl,
almost as old as you, but not half as handsome, and
four other children, who have your name on their
lips, and who speak of nothing but the hope that
they will some day meet you and be able to thank
you for keeping a father on earth for them, through
the mercy of the Father above.”</p>

<p>All this the captain was saying as he led our
heroine to the best state-room on the boat, and told
her, too, that there was every promise of a beautiful
night ahead, and a fine run.</p>

<p>“You found that my card took the place of
tickets, didn’t you?” he asked, as he called the
chambermaid to wait on one whom he considered a
guest rather than a passenger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[195]</span></p>

<p>“You’ll forgive me, captain, I know,” she answered,
“when I tell you I gave your card to a poor
weeping widow woman whose pocket had been
picked in the depot, and who had not even a ticket
to come on with.”</p>

<p>Georgiana did not add that she gave the poor
woman fifty dollars in cash also.</p>

<p>“It was just like you, and I can’t blame you. I’d
have helped her myself,” said the good captain.
“It’s a kind of a Smith’s failing to put their hands
in their pockets when they see any one in distress,
and not to take their hands out of their pockets
empty.”</p>

<p>And now, having his duties to perform, the captain
excused himself, and our heroine made herself
comfortable for the trip.</p>

<p>When the steamer started, our heroine went upon
the upper deck to enjoy the air and view, and having
asked the captain as a favor not to speak of her
being the person who had notified him of his danger
on that stormy trip, she felt safe from undue notice.</p>

<p>But she was recognized by both the pilots, who
raised their hats when she approached the pilot-house,
and presently, when the captain came up, he
gave her a chair inside the house, whence she could
look and enjoy herself without feeling the cold wind
that blew in from seaward.</p>

<p>Had not the captain and pilots, as requested, been
cautious, our heroine would have been lionized, so
to speak, on that trip, for there was an unusual number
of passengers.</p>

<p>There was only one passenger on board who did
approach her, and that was the grateful widow
whom she had relieved in her dire distress.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">HATTIE’S WELCOME.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Sakes alive, here she is! We were just a-talkin’
about you, me and Biddy here, for Germany can’t
talk no more’n a cat to us.”</p>

<p>That was the welcome Miss Scrimp gave to Hattie
Butler as she opened the door on the morning of her
arrival in New York.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Miss Scrimp,” said the latter, in
her ever quiet, lady-like way. “I have returned,
you see.”</p>

<p>“Yes’m, and I’m glad of it. I missed you so much.
The girls have all been wild over what the papers
said about you savin’ so many lives on the steamer.
Was it all so?”</p>

<p>“I suppose it was, Miss Scrimp.”</p>

<p>“Sakes alive! Have you been to breakfast?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I took breakfast on the boat. The captain
insisted on it.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s lucky, for the girls did eat so hearty
this morning there isn’t much left, and it’s all cold
before this time. There comes Biddy—she’s heard
your voice.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you born angel!” cried Biddy, running up to
Hattie and giving her a real, warm Celtic hug.
“I’ve got the new dress all made up—a real warrum
one for winter wear, d’ye see. The mistress has
hers, but it’s silk, and I’d rather have mine twice
over. Shall I get ye’s a real nice cup of coffee? I
can make it quick.”</p>

<p>“No, thank you, Biddy. I’ll run up to my room a<span class="pagenum">[197]</span>
little while, and then I am going up town on a visit.
I shall not go to the bindery until to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Why, you’re in mournin’! Sakes alive, I didn’t
notice that till this minute. I was so glad to see you.
Who’s dead, dear?” asked Miss Scrimp.</p>

<p>“My mother!” answered Hattie, choking down a
sob as she started up stairs for her room.</p>

<p>“Her mother! Poor thing! I’ll be a mother to
her now!” said Miss Scrimp, thinking of that thousand
dollar check most likely.</p>

<p>Hattie found everything in her room as she had
left it. She had long before had the lock put on herself,
and it was one which no other key in the house
fitted, or Miss Scrimp might have explored her
apartment in her absence.</p>

<p>The young lady remained up stairs but a short
time, and when she came out she took an up town
street car, and started to see her kind friends, the
Legares and Mrs. Emory, as well as dear Little Jessie
Albemarle.</p>

<p>When she arrived there, such a welcome met her!
Lizzie, Mrs. Emory, and Jessie covered her with
kisses. Mr. Legare pressed her hand warmly, and
poor Frank stammered and blushed, and hardly
knew what he said, though he tried to be very polite,
and at the same time very ardent in his expressions
of pleasure at seeing her once more.</p>

<p>And he hurried to inform her that Mr. W—— had
gone to California.</p>

<p>“One rival out of the way!” he said to himself.</p>

<p>But his hopes went below zero when she calmly
told him she knew he was going before she left
town, and he had telegraphed to her when he was
on the point of starting.</p>

<p>“They’re engaged. I know they are!” groaned<span class="pagenum">[198]</span>
Frank to Lizzie, while Hattie was telling Mrs.
Emory of the death of her mother.</p>

<p>“Who, you goose?” asked Lizzie. “What are you
ready to blubber out a crying for?”</p>

<p>“Ned W—— would never have telegraphed to her
all about his going off if they weren’t engaged!” almost
sobbed Frank.</p>

<p>“Pooh! What is it to us, anyway?”</p>

<p>“To me, who is almost dying for her love—to me
it’s everything. I tell you plain, sister, if Hattie Butler
will not have me, I’ll go and enlist as a private
soldier in the army, and get killed by Indians, or
I’ll ship in a whaler, and fall overboard and break
my neck!”</p>

<p>“Or swallow a whale like Jonah did,” said Lizzie,
laughing. “Don’t be foolish, Frank. If she’ll only
love you, it will all come right, and if she will not—why,
you wouldn’t want to marry a girl without
love!”</p>

<p>“No,” said Frank, with some hesitation. Then he
added: “If she loves him she can’t love me. I wish
he was dead. Who is she in mourning for?”</p>

<p>“Her mother. I heard her tell Aunt Louisa so a
few seconds ago.”</p>

<p>“Poor thing! I wish father would adopt her. No,
I don’t either, for then she’d be my sister, and I
want her for my wife.”</p>

<p>Hattie now had a hundred questions to answer
about the storm, and the steamer, which she did
cheerfully.</p>

<p>After dinner Frank had the glory of escorting her
home in the family carriage alone—Lizzie pleading a
headache, just to give the poor boy a chance to
make love to Hattie if he could.</p>

<p>But he never opened his mouth from the time he<span class="pagenum">[199]</span>
left home till he set her down at the door of her
boarding-house. He couldn’t have done it to save
his life. He had caught the love-fever in dead
earnest.</p>

<p>Mr. W—— stayed but three days in San Francisco.
Advertising for a foreman and hands, he
was soon overrun with applicants, and had plenty to
choose from—good, sober, reliable men. Good materials,
too, were plenty to begin with, and in just
three days the great “Occidental Book Bindery” of
E. W—— &amp; Son was advertised in every paper in
San Francisco, and the shop in full blast.</p>

<p>And the same evening Mr. W—— took the Sacramento
boat, and was speeding on his way to Oroville,
where he was to meet the agent and banker of
Wells, Fargo &amp; Co., and take his final departure in
search of the “Mountain Home,” which he had
seen in the sketch spoken of long ago, and a copy of
which was in the letter of instructions which he carried
from our Hattie.</p>

<p>From Sacramento by rail Mr. W—— dashed on
toward Feather River, and before noon he was at
the old National Hotel, with a dozen Chinamen at
hand ready to dust him off, wash his clothes, or pick
his pockets if the chance came around.</p>

<p>From the polite clerk he soon learned the location
of Wells, Fargo &amp; Co.’s office and bank, and in a
short time he was in the private office of the latter.</p>

<p>With his letter of introduction extended, he introduced
his name, and was met with that cordial,<span class="pagenum">[200]</span>
open-handed, open-hearted welcome which the
stranger ever gets in California.</p>

<p>To Mr. Morrison, the agent—a splendid young
man—Mr. W—— opened his business, asking if he
knew a Mr. Harry Porchet, who was mining on the
uppermost claim on Feather River.</p>

<p>“I know all of him that any one can know,” said
Mr. Morrison. “He is a very singular young man—ever
sad and melancholy, strictly temperate, not
even touching wine, using no tobacco, seeking no
company. I tried to get him to stay a few days at my
home; and once, when he came to deposit his gold,
as he does every three months, induced him to take
tea with me, where I thought my Sister Annie, one of
the most gifted girls on this coast, and a fine conversationalist,
might draw him out of his melancholy
mood. But it was no use. He was polite and gentlemanly,
but he would not thaw, as we say out
here.”</p>

<p>“I must find him,” said Mr. W——, with a sigh;
for he felt as if he was sealing his own fate as a
single man forever, if he found this young man all
that he was represented to be, and called him out
from the shadow of his gloomy exile into the sunlight
of Georgiana Lonsdale’s presence.</p>

<p>“I will get you mules and a guide, for there is no
other means of travel when you get into the mountains
up Feather River,” said Mr. Morrison; “and,
as you cannot start with everything ready, camping
fit-out and all, before morning, take tea with me
to-night.”</p>

<p>Mr. W—— consented, and when that evening he
met the sister of the young banker and express
agent, saw and viewed her wonderful beauty, and
heard her sing songs of her own composition, accompanied<span class="pagenum">[201]</span>
on piano and guitar, he thought that if
young Porchet could be so blind to those attractions,
he was indeed true to the love he left behind him.</p>

<p>The next morning Mr. W——, with an old mountain
man for a guide, on a sure-footed mule, with
two others in the train carrying provisions and
stores, started on the perilous journey.</p>

<p>All day, creeping slowly along narrow trails, now
on a ledge barely wide enough for the mule-path,
overhanging the wild rushing river a thousand feet
below—then pressing through chaparral so thick the
animals could just get ahead—now shivering just
below the snow range on a wind-swept ridge, then
pitching down into a mining gulch full of busy men
all grimy with yellow dirt—on they went the entire
day long, halting but an hour at noon to give the
mules a little barley and themselves a scanty lunch.</p>

<p>That night they camped in a grove of tall sugar
pines, a little way back from the river, and over the
camp-fire Mr. W—— listened to thrilling stories of
what California life was in ’49, when every one
who came was mad with the greed for gold—when
vice and crime ran hand in hand, life only held by
the pistol-grip or knife point, and property held
more by might than right.</p>

<p>Early next day they were on the move up stream,
now obliged to follow the river bank as near as possible,
for the snowy range of the Sierra Nevada rose
high above their heads.</p>

<p>At noon they came to a lonely little valley, not
two acres in extent, shaded at one end by half a
dozen trees and a huge overhanging precipice.</p>

<p>Here two fat, sleek mules fed undisturbed, and as
they rode up near them, the guide pointed to a pack<span class="pagenum">[202]</span>
and riding-saddle hanging side by side under the
cliff.</p>

<p>“Here we camp. The man I seek is within a mile
of this place, but no one outside of him ever went
over the trail that reaches his claim, so far as I can
learn,” said Mr. W——, carefully looking over his
map, sketch, and letter of instruction. “I will lunch,
and then, leaving you here, try to find him.”</p>

<p>The guide assented. He had never been up the
river quite so far before, and, old hand as he was in
the mountains, he did not want to go any farther.</p>

<p>Half an hour later Mr. W—— left, heading for a
black patch of chaparral that seemed to hang on the
side of a fearful cliff.</p>

<p>He was gone over two hours, and he came back in
a fearful stage of agitation.</p>

<p>“My friend is found,” he said. “But I fear that
the joy of the news I carried him has killed him. I
found him sick—very low. Thinking it would revive
him, I broke my news too suddenly. I left him
in a death-like swoon, and I could not revive him.
Come with me quickly. I will pay you treble our
agreement if we can only get him out safe, where I
can get medical aid.”</p>

<p>The guide did not hesitate a second. He was
rough, but all heart. His name was Hal Westcott.</p>

<p>After a fearful climb, which took them all of
thirty minutes, the two men stood breathless on the
plateau we saw in the sketch in front of the log
cabin and above the whirl of milk-white waters.</p>

<p>“I almost dread to go in lest he be dead,” said Mr.
W——.</p>

<p>The guide pushed forward without a pause.</p>

<p>“Zep! He is worth a thousand dead men!” cried
bluff Hal Westcott. “He is sitting up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[203]</span></p>

<p>He was reading her blessed letter of recall. He
was thin as a shadow, white with suffering and
hunger, too, for he had been parched and dried up
with fever, and had not touched food for days.</p>

<p>“But I am better,” he said. “I will live now. I
did not care to live till this came.”</p>

<p>And he kissed the letter, while tears ran down his
thin, wasted face.</p>

<p>The two strong men literally wept over him, while
they hurried to make weak broth and boil some rice
and water for his drink.</p>

<p>Two days—their mules resting and feeding in the
glade below—they tended and nursed him, and
watched over him with such care as few suffering
men ever got in a bleak place like that.</p>

<p>Then, handling him almost as they would have
done an infant, they got him down to the other
camp; and they took the gold and his arms and
packed them down also, so as to be ready to start
for the outside world on the third day.</p>

<p>It would be a long, perhaps a dry story to tell in
detail were I to describe that journey out. It had
taken W—— and his guide but a day and a half to
come in. Yet it was four days after their start when
poor Porchet was laid upon a nice cool bed in Belle
Vista Cottage, as Mr. Morrison called his home.</p>

<p>And within an hour after, Mr. W—— telegraphed
to Miss Hattie Butler:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have found him. He is all right—a noble and
a true man. I love him as I would a brother. He
has been sick, is weak yet, but we will start East in
two or three days by the fastest trains. Your ever
unchanging and unforgetting friend,</p>

<p class="ir2 pminus1">“<span class="smcap">Edward.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[204]</span></p>

<p>He told Harry Porchet what he had done, and the
latter said:</p>

<p>“You are only too good. Heaven will reward you
for it all, and make you happy.”</p>

<p>Oh, how little did he realize that Edward W——
was sacrificing all his hopes of happiness in carrying
back to her he loved the man whom she only could
love.</p>

<p>Tenderly cared for, and attended by the best physician
in Oroville, with good, kind nursing, it was
no wonder that the invalid was so soon ready to
start out for the East.</p>

<p>Edward W—— went down to San Francisco for a
single day, to see that all things went well in the
Occidental Bindery, and then returned ready to
start eastward.</p>

<p>The very next morning he telegraphed again:</p>

<p class="center">“We are coming. We leave Sacramento on the
10:30 train. All well!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLIII">CHAPTER XLIII.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">HATTIE LEAVES THE BINDERY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It was well for her chance of quiet that Hattie
Butler took her place in the office, where none could
invade without permission, when she returned to the
bindery, for every one wanted to see and, if but for
a moment, to speak to the heroine whom the papers
had made famous.</p>

<p>Even a reporter, and they are everywhere, heard
she was there, and got as far as the office door to
interview her. But Mr. Jones bravely stood there,
paste-brush in hand, and saved her from the cruel
infliction.</p>

<p>And thus she lived on, day after day, until almost
three weeks had passed, and then there came to her
a telegram from the West.</p>

<p>Oh, what a joyous look came over her face when
she read it!</p>

<p>Jones said, when he told the little wife at home
about it, that Miss Hattie looked just as she, the little
wife, had looked when she stood up in church
and promised to be his until death should them
part.</p>

<p>“Is it from the boss?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, and such glorious news!” she cried.</p>

<p>“Then he has got the bindery started?” asked
Jones.</p>

<p>“He says not one word about the bindery,” said
Miss Butler, abruptly.</p>

<p>And Jones was left to wonder what on earth the
news could be that was so glorious, and yet not a
word about the branch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[206]</span></p>

<p>He was completely nonplused, as a lawyer friend
of mine said one day when he wanted me to think
he knew Latin.</p>

<p>For a few days more everything at the bindery
went on as usual, and then there came another telegram.</p>

<p>Miss Hattie looked exceedingly joyous over this,
and now told Mr. Jones that the branch bindery
was going nicely, and that Mr. W—— was coming
home, and would be there in just seven days if no
accident occurred on the way.</p>

<p>And then she told him that she should close up all
her work and leave the bindery on the next day.
She would arrange his books and pay-rolls as she
had been doing all the time, up to the end of the
week, and then it would be easy for him to run matters
until Mr. W—— was in the shop again.</p>

<p>Here was another poser for poor Mr. Jones. Why
should Hattie Butler post off to Boston, as she said
she was going there, when Mr. W—— was expected
home?</p>

<p>“I thought she set a heap o’ store by him and he
by her,” said Jones, talking it over to his wife.
“And now when he is coming back, she puts right
out as if she didn’t want to see him at all.”</p>

<p>“It’s a sure sign she loves him—she is bashful
like, as I was once,” said Mrs. Jones. “You’ll see.
He’ll follow her to Boston, there’ll be a short bit o’
courtin’, and then a grand weddin’, and Mr. W——
will come back with his bride on his arm as proud as
you was when you kissed me before the parson could
get a chance.”</p>

<p>And that was all the good woman knew about it.</p>

<p>There was tribulation that night at the supper-table
at Miss Scrimp’s. Hattie Butler, in a tone of<span class="pagenum">[207]</span>
deep feeling, told all the girl boarders she was about
to leave them forever. She called each one to her
and kissed her, after supper, and gave her a gold
ring, with the name of “Hattie” on it, as a remembrance,
and she told them, while she thanked them
for their ever kind feeling to her, she would not forget
them in the distant home to which she was
going. If any of them ever was sick, or in distress,
if they would send a note to Hattie Butler, care of
Mr. W——, at the bindery, it would reach her, and
she would relieve them, for God had been good to
her; she was rich now, and willing to serve Him by
sharing her riches with those who were in want or
suffering.</p>

<p>The girls kissed her, and wept over her. It
seemed as if they could not let her go.</p>

<p>For, in those long years, she had won the love of
every one who knew her, Miss Scrimp alone excepted.</p>

<p>That “old barnacle” (I got that idea from Roger
Starbuck) couldn’t love anything but money and—her
wretched old self.</p>

<p>Miss Scrimp got no gold ring, but she got her bill
in full, and a week over, as Hattie had run one day
into another week, or rather would begin by taking
breakfast in the morning.</p>

<p>After this scene was over, Hattie went up to her
room, got out her well-worn writing-desk, and wrote
several notes, which we can judge of when one is
taken as a specimen.</p>

<p>That one was addressed to Miss Lizzie Legare. It
ran thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear and Kind Friend</span>:—You know there has
been ever something mysterious about me—not
wrong, yet a something which I could not fully explain.<span class="pagenum">[208]</span>
In another note I have invited your father,
brother, aunt, and Little Jessie, all to visit me at
my home, No. — Beacon street, Boston, on the
seventh day from to-day, at four in the afternoon,
to remain there as a guest that night and as long as
you will. Darling, I have written at length to you—to
the others, extended only an invitation. Mr.
Edward W——, his sisters and parents, will also be
there, and a gentleman whom you have never seen.
Come, darling, come.</p>

<p class="center pminus1">“Lovingly,</p>

<p class="center pminus1" style="padding-left:12em">“<span class="smcap">Georgiana E. Lonsdale</span>, <em>nee</em> ‘Hattie Butler.’”</p>
</div>

<p>Hattie—or, shall we call her Georgiana after this—was
on her way to Boston when those notes went
out to their several destinations, carrying wonder
and surprise to each recipient. Even Captain Smith
got one, in which he was told to bring his whole
family, and Mr. Jones was not forgotten, nor the little
woman and baby.</p>

<p>In the Legare house there was wonder and joy in
all but one heart.</p>

<p>“I wonder who the gentleman is whom we have
never seen?” moaned Frank. “It’ll be just my luck—there’ll
be a wedding; she’ll be the bride, and I’ll
be a shadow, standing back like cold beef alongside
of hot turkey.”</p>

<p>And there was yet more wonder with Edward
W——’s sisters. But they vowed they’d go even if
she had been a bindery girl.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLIV">CHAPTER XLIV.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THINE FOREVER!</span></h2>
</div>


<p>In front of the finest mansion on Beacon Hill,
though the chill of autumn was in the air and a
northeast wind came cold from over the bay, an
arch of hot-house flowers was erected, covering the
entrance to the walk, which led up through a yard
ornamented with choice works in marble, to the
carved door of the house.</p>

<p>On this arch, in crimson flowers, the word “welcome”
was visible.</p>

<p>Inside, servants well—even richly—dressed seemed
to flit to and fro, and a lady, young and beautiful,
robed for that day as richly as a royal queen, moved
to and fro, seeing in person that everything was
ready to receive the guests for whom the welcome
was meant.</p>

<p>The minister, who had been in that house on a
sad, sad day, now stood by this young lady’s side,
looking dignified but happy.</p>

<p>The old lawyer and many other friends <a id="Ref_209" href="#BRef_209">were</a> there,
and more came along, as the day wore on, in grand
carriages, the elite of the aristocratic old city.</p>

<p>And now the hour—four o’clock—was close at
hand. Her carriages had gone to the train to meet
the guests who had been invited to come from New
York—carriages for all.</p>

<p>And she, who had been all this time flushed and
excited, now stood pale and nervous near the door.
For a roll and rattle of wheels was heard, and a moment
later a whole column of coaches dashed up in
front of the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[210]</span></p>

<p>From the first stepped two men, and, arm in arm,
they came under the arch, and never knight of crimson
cross looked so happy as did the younger, paler
of the two, when he looked up and saw those words.</p>

<p>But they could not pause—others were hurrying
on behind and in front. He saw her at the door, and
with a wild, glad cry, he was in her arms.</p>

<p>“Georgiana—mine at last!”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, my Harry, thine forever!”</p>

<p>A moment’s sobs of joy broke on the air, but then,
arm in arm, they went on, while an unseen orchestra
played a brilliant march of joy and triumph.</p>

<p>And then, in the great parlor, darkened outside,
but blazing with light within, without waiting for
more than a few words and whispered greetings,
before the friends of bright days and the true friends
of darker hours, Georgiana Lonsdale was married
to the returned exile—to the man for whom she had
dared her parents’ anger, whom she had so nearly
lost—by his own fault, and who had come back to
her redeemed.</p>

<p>Edward W—— stood at his right hand, Lizzie Legare
stood by her dear friend, and the ceremony,
brief but impressive, was performed. When it was
over, all moved out to the banquet hall, and though
no wine colored the cloth or tempted man to fall, a
more delicious repast was never served.</p>

<p>After it was over, at Georgiana’s request, her husband,
noble and proud in his true reformation, told
the listening guests the strange, strange story. He,
that old attorney’s poor clerk, had met and loved
Georgiana, the only child and heir of those rich
parents. They had scorned him, for they had higher
views for her—drove him from their door. She, in
her love and pride, had vowed to be his, and together<span class="pagenum">[211]</span>
they fled to New York, there to be united in
wedlock. He, in his too exuberant joy, forgot his
manhood, and when they should have been ready to
stand up before the minister was too intoxicated to
stand.</p>

<p>Crushed and indignant, she waited until he was
sober enough to realize what he had done, and then
she told him to go forth and never, never to return
until his manhood was redeemed, and he could stand
a free man before his God, sworn and proven true
in the full fruits of temperance. He went. She
would not go back to the home she had left, but at
once sought employment in the humblest line.</p>

<p>There, dear reader, we found her. You have had
the story. It is a strange one, but to a very great
extent it is true. And, as a young writer, I can only
hope it will do the good I wish it should do. That it
will give courage to the weak, hope to the hopeless,
for no one is so lost or fallen but that a higher, better
life may be reached.</p>

<p>I suppose I may as well tell you, Mr. Edward
W—— is now trying to forget his first disappointment
in the smiles of sweet Lizzie Legare, and
Frank has “gone West.”</p>

<p>If there is anyone that says we Americans have no
literature of our own, let him read the books of Mrs. E.
D. E. N. Southworth. This author may be said to have
written truly great American novels. The scenes of all
of her stories are laid in America, are about American
people and deal with the mode of living peculiar to
the American.</p>

<p>Most of Mrs. Southworth’s books are pen pictures
of the hopes and fears, the joys and sorrows of good old-fashioned
folk, but do not think on that account that
they are old-fashioned.</p>

<p>Her works have always been considered standard romances
and will be of just the same intense interest
twenty years hence as they were upon the day when
they were first written.</p>

<p>We would like to send you a complete catalogue of
Mrs. Southworth’s books, but if you want to see just
what this author has done, buy copies of “Em,” and
